<h1 class="page-title">Regional Meetups</h1>

<p>The Dozenal Society of America holds
occasional regional meetups in addition to the <a
href="annual-meetings.html">Annual
Meeting</a> in various locations around the country.  These
occur irregularly and are typically held by individual
members who live in that area; in the past such meetups
have occurred in St. Louis, MO and Chicago, IL.  We chat
about your ideas, duodecimal mathematics and systems of
numeration in an informal venue. Duodecimal literature
(The Manual of the Dozen System, recent Duodecimal Bulletin
hardcopies, and handouts, each while supplies last) are
available at the meetings; everyone comes home with dozenal
goodies. Tell us what you think, share your thoughts or
suggestions, and have a great dozenal time! Let’s touch
base, literally!</p>

<p>For information on these
meetups, please contact us at <a
href="mailto:Contact@dozenal.org">Contact@dozenal.org</a>;
we hope to continue holding them in the Midwest, and to
begin holding them in the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast.
If you'd like to assist with such a meetup in these or
other areas, please contact us, as well.</p>

<h2>The 2011 Midwestern Summer Socials</h2>

<p>A couple Members turned out at the Schlafly Tap Room in
St. Louis Wednesday evening, 17 August 2011 (Wednesday 15;
August 11E7;). An engineer, architect, and web designer
go to a bar, and discuss number bases and the efficiency
of dozenal, especially with fractions. (No joke!) One
came to dozenal when he was attempting to build an analog
decimal clock. He got to thinking of the implications on
units of measure; if the second were abandoned, what would
that do to the watt? He then visited this site and came to
join for the sheer sake of intellectual consideration of
dozenal. He prefers the printed version of the Duodecimal
Bulletin. We had a ball and discussed travels in Europe
and our careers.</p>

<p>Three Members met at Panera Bread near the Woodfield
Mall in Schaumburg near Chicago Sunday afternoon, 30 July
2011 (Sunday 26; July 11E7;). We discussed music and the
dozen, as one of the Members wrote a three-part article
on music for the Bulletin (which we will be digitally
remastering). We discussed dozenal mathematics and what
brought us to dozenal.</p>

<h2>Get-togethers at “Home”</h2>

<p>In St. Louis, we might dine etc., visiting the
St. Louis office if desired before or afterwards, where
we can discuss any dozenal issue at length. The St. Louis
office of the DSA is home to a full range of dozenal
literature, including every issue of the Duodecimal
Bulletin, the British Duodecimal Review, Duodecimal
Newscast, Dozenal Journal, the Australian Modular
Conversion Bureau, and writings from New Zealand. George
Terry’s Duodecimal Arithmetic, Jean Essig’s Douze
Notre Dix Futur, Dr. Glaser’s A History of Binary
and Non Decimal Numeration, Andrew’s works are also
available for review. It is also the production center
for the Duodecimal Bulletin. St. Louis is notable for
its many fine restaurants, catering to practically any
cuisine. Let’s discuss a favorite subject at a venue that
facilitates our love of twelveness! If you’re in town and
game to discuss dozens, let us know! (Give us a heads-up,
a couple weeks in advance if possible).</p>

<h2>General Information on Get-togethers “Away”</h2>

<p>Our regional get-togethers are not formal, but we
will be prepared to talk about dozenal mathematics. Some
printed resources will be available. We like to tailor
our regional get-togethers to those who attend. Folks
who respond can request or suggest venues, meeting times
and topics, and resources that we bring to the meeting
(Contact us here). If you’re suggesting a venue outside
St. Louis, bear in mind that we may “talk business”,
involving handouts, publications, etc., and don’t want
to bother other diners. So the place should be one where
business is welcome. Note that all “away” meetings
are limited by the fact that the DSA relies on volunteer
efforts; we can’t reach many locations. In general,
the meetings are arranged by traveling Members who happen
to be in the area, or are within a radius of the places
participating Members live.</p>

<p>Generally, we’ll take a look at the current Duodecimal
Bulletin issue under production, and will have Membership
Forms on hand for your convenience.</p>
