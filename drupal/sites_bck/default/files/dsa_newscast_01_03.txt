------------------------DOZENAL NEWS------------------------

We missed it at the time, but back in January D'Arcy Flynn's
blog posted a lovely little piece on dozenals:
  http://www.darcyflynn.com/decimal-vs-duodecimal/
A   citizen   of  the   Dominion   of   Canada,  Mr.   Flynn
understandably  conflates  the   American  system  with  the
imperial one; as a  basic run-down of dozenal's superiority,
though, it's a good read.

The Society  has published another newly  remastered dozenal
work in the  last month. _Systems of Numeration:  A Plea for
the Duodecimal_,  by Rev.  Thomas J.  A. Freeman,  S.J., was
originally published in 1119 (1893.) in the United States.
  http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/systems-numeration-plea-duodecimal
It  is   a  wonderfully   complete  and   yet  light-hearted
exposition of the advantages of the dozenal base. Well worth
the time to read.

The Society has also released a new utility available at our
Resources page.  This tool is a desktop or toolbar clock for
KDE desktops, primarily run on GNU/Linux or BSD systems.  It
gives the time (in hours), with dozenal subdivisions of
hours, like a normal dozenal number; e.g., "03;X0" for our
customary "3:50."  On mouseover, it gives the Gregorian date
in dozenal.
  http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/kde-desktop-dozenal-clock
KDE users should find this a great dozenal tool.

----------------------SOCIETY BUSINESS----------------------

No new  business this month,  other than to  again encourage
members to try  to make plans to attend  the Annual Meeting.
If you would like to come  but can't make it, please contact
us:
  Contact@dozenal.org
It may be possible to arrange a local meet-up of members and
other interested persons.

---------------------POETICAL DIVERSION---------------------

TO DOZENAL PATRIOTS, AN ANTHEM

Rise, you children of the dozen,
the day of glory has arrived!
'gainst the hateful dec'mal's tyranny
The dozen's standard has been raised,
the dozen's standard has been raised!
The roar of these ferocious soldiers?
They come to take your simple thirds,
to take your quarters and your sixths!

To arms, doz'nalists!
Divide up in four ways!
March on, march on!
An impure base
will fall to dozen's strength!

(With thanks to the good people of Marseilles.)
