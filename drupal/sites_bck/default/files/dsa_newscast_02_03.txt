============================================================

Members,  please  remember that  while  dues  are no  longer
required for membership, we still  rely on the generosity of
members  to keep  the DSA  going. Donations  of any  amount,
large or small, are welcome and needed.

A  donation   of  $10;  ($12.)  will   procure  Subscription
membership, and entitles the payer to receive both a digital
and  a paper  copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other
members will  receive only  a digital  copy. To  invoke this

=          TIMOTHY TRAVIS ON THE RAENBO CALENDAR           =
============================================================

Timothy Travis (#342) wanted to explain a bit more about his
dozenal  calendar proposal.  Readers may  remember that  his
Raenbo system was  published some time ago; it  has now been
updated to include that calendar:

    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/raenbo-dozenals

Mr. Travis says:

    The Raenbo Calendar  has 12 months of  30 days each.
    The  5  extra  days  in  the  year  become  solstice
    and  equinox  holidays  falling  between  the  four,
    three-month, seasons. So that  every month looks the
    same  (and every  year),  it is  necessary for  each
    month to have 5 *weeks of 6 days* each. Once this is
    done,  the  calendar  just  magically  tumbles  into
    place, as  if this were  the way it was  supposed to
    have been all along.

    Please note that the celestial year is not precisely
    divided into  four equal  segments by  the solstices
    and  equinoxes.  So,  on the  Raenbo  Calendar,  the
    solstice and equinox holidays  are not always on the
    actual  days on  which the  solstices and  equinoxes
    occur. But  they are  close enough causing  no great
    confusion or inconvenience.

=             LIVING DOZENS:  TELLING THE TIME             =
============================================================

Time is a measurement system that we use more often than any
other. Constantly  throughout the  day we are  giving times;
five  minutes  until  this,  ten minutes  until  that,  only
fifteen minutes  before five, and  so on. And yet  though we
dozenalists often  point to  our current  clock as  a superb
example of dozens  in action, how often do we  really use it
as such?

Regardless of whether we support keeping our current hour or
replacing it with the duor, the fact remains that the entire
world, even in metric countries,  uses a system of time that
is based  fundamentally on the dozen;  it is one of  the few
times that  we can  use dozens consistently  without looking
crazy. In other words, it is  a great tool, even if we would
like to  eventually replace  the hour. Let's  look at  a few
ways how to use it.

The twelfth  of the hour, of  course, is simply a  period of
five minutes. This period is very  often the one that we use
generically to  mean "a  short time"  or "pretty  soon." How
often, when  we say,  "I'll be  there in  five," do  we mean
literally "I'll  be there  in five  minutes"? More  often we
mean simply "I'm almost there, and will be there soon." It's
used this way  so often that we frequently it's  made into a
unit by itself, where we use "five" by itself.

So  why  not  formalize  this?   Call  it  a  "five,"  or  a
"block"  (this  latter  term  has gained  some  use  on  the
DozensOnline forum,  and has even been  used occasionally by
non-dozenalists); and remember that there are twelve of them
in an  hour. On a  particularly busy day, perhaps  a meeting
room could be reserved in blocks. Someone who needs a longer
period might reserve two or three blocks.

Requiring no additional terms  is using dozenal fractions in
the hour.  We already use  terms like "quarter to  five" and
the like; why not extend this? Since there are twelve blocks
in  an  hour,  we  have  the  full  flexibility  of  dozenal
fractions to  work with.  Halves, thirds,  quarters, sixths,
and twelfths are all immediately  present, with the big hand
pointing straight at the uncial digit.

"I'll be  done in a  third of an hour."  Non-dozenalists may
have to  think about this for  a moment, as they  would with
the slightly unusual  expression "I'll be done  in a quarter
of an hour," but it's not  hard to understand. A sixth of an
hour or a twelfth of an hour will take more thought for most
people; but again, it'll come to  them, and it may also give
an opportunity to talk about dozenals if they're curious.

Our  clocks, unfortunately,  are mostly  hard-wired to  have
inferior,  double-digit representations  of ten  and eleven.
For  digital  clocks,  there's  really no  remedy  for  this
problem (though  the DSA "Resources"  page has an  option or
two). Analog clocks, however, are different.

Consider covering the "10," "11," and "12" on your clock and
replacing them with your preferred symbols for X, E, and 10.
Most clocks have face-covers  which are easily removable and
replaceable, so that the clock can be set to the right time,
so doing this is pretty trivial.  If you want the symbols to
match 1-9 exactly, or if you want a separate identity symbol
set, cover them all, or even  the whole face, with your own.
Drawing the appropriate symbols on small pieces of paper and
taping  or gluing  them  on  will suffice;  it  needs to  be
clearly legible, not artistically beautiful (unless you want
it to be). Replace the face cover, if there is one, and hang
it up on  your wall. You now have a  dozenal clock! Not only
will this help  you personally use dozenals  more often, but
it's a great conversation starter.

Make use  of our dozenal time;  it will be a  great help for
yourself and for others.

============================================================

The New  York Times has  published a brief explanation  of a
long-standing  proof  that  an infinite  series  of  integer
additions is equal to -0;1.

    http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/science/in-the-end-it-all-adds-up-to.html

This counterintuitive result is  a great illustration of the
way that our favorite number is woven into the fabric of the
universe.

One of the two major mathematical publications by one of our
founders, F.  Emerson Andrews,  was originally  published in
1175 (1961.).  Because its  copyright was not  renewed, this
means  that _Numbers,  Please_  has fallen  into the  public
domain!

    http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027385338

The  full text  is  available at  this  link, including  the
lovely illustrations  done by  Aldren A. Watson.  Sadly, his
other and  more important work, _New  Numbers_, was properly
renewed,  causing it  to  be  a pretty  rare  work. But  the
chapter  on  dozens  in  _Numbers, Please_  is  still  quite
interesting.

The Society has published another "early" dozenal work, this
time from William  B. Smith, writing a  short but compelling
defense of the dozenal system in the _Educational Review_ of
1117 (1891):

    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/twelve-vs-ten

This article, which evidently inspired another article which
the DSA has republished by  Rev. Thomas Freeman (a much more
light-hearted and  entertaining work), gives  an interesting
account  of  dozenalism,  including even  a  (very)  briefly
sketched-out metric system based on the hour and the yard.

------------Updated Bulletin Issue 51:1 (WN X1)-------------

The DSA has  released an updated version  of _The Duodecimal
Bulletin_ Issue 51:1 (WN X1):

    http://www.dozenal.org/DuodecimalBulletinIssue511a.pdf

The content of this splendid issue has not been altered; the
revised version merely fixes  a few typographical errors and
the like. It can accessed at  the above address or from your
members page on the website.

--------------NCTM Conference in Richmond, VA---------------

Thanks to the  efforts of our Treasurer  and Board Chairman,
Jay Schiffman; and our Secretary, Jen Seron, the Society has
managed  to  secure  another great  opportunity  to  further
the  Society's   mission  of  educating  the   public  about
alternative bases. Our proposal to present a workshop at the
regional conference  of the National Council  of Teachers of
Mathematics has been accepted!

The program  is similar  to, but  still different  from, the
program we  presented at  the ASEE  conference last  year in
Atlanta.  The conference  is from  10;-12; November  11EX in
Richmond, VA; we do not yet know which date our program will
be on.

Our program  in Atlanta  was attended by  a small  number of
people, but produced great results and a lot of interest. It
also resulted in a lot  of great educational material, which
can be  found on our website  under "Educational Materials."
These materials are now among  the most popular items on our
website.

We'll post further details  regarding the NCTM conference as
they become available. Thanks again, Jay and Jen!

------------------Annual Meeting for 11EX-------------------

Due to the NCTM conference, the DSA's annual meeting will be
later than normal this year, likely on 13; November 11EX, in
Richmond, VA. Further  details will be posted  when they are
available.  We hope you'll be able to join us!

============================================================

Originally  published  in our  _Bulletin_,  WN  70, this  is
another gem from the same great figure of dozenal history.

            Edgar Allan Poe's Eldorado Revisited

        Gaily bedight,
        A gallant knight,
   In sunshine and in shadin',
        Had journeyed long,
        Singing a song,
   In search of el do dozen.

        But he grew old---
        This knight so bold---
   And o'er his heart a shadin',
        Fell as he found
        No spot of ground
   That looked like el do dozen.

        And, as his strength,
        Failed him at length,
   He met a pilgrim shadin',
        "Shading", said he,
        "Where can it be---
   This land of el do dozen?"

        "Over the Countin'
        Out by tens,
   Down the Valley of the Weighin',
        Ride, boldly ride,"
        The shade replied,---
   "If you seek for el do dozen!"

With thanks to H. C. Churchman.
