============================================================

Members! Important news  from the annual meeting  of 11E9 as
regards dues. The Board of Directors has determined that, in
the  interests of  making  the DSA  more  accessible to  the
public, and to remove any  remaining stumbling blocks to the
recruitment of new members, dues  will no longer be required
for membership in the DSA as of 1 January 11EX (2014.).

A fee  of $10; ($12.) will  procure Subscription membership,
and entitles the payer to receive both a digital and a paper
copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other members  will
receive  only  a  digital  copy. Members  who  have  already
paid  their dues  this  year  will be  entitled  to a  paper
subscription if  requested; if you  have done so,  and would
like  to  invoke  this,  please notify  the  Editor  of  the
Bulletin, Mike deVlieger, at

    mdevlieger@dozenal.org

Although we no longer require  dues, please remember that we
are  a volunteer  organization  which pays  no salaries.  As
such,  the  generosity of  our  membership  is necessary  to
continue pursuing  our mission. Donations of  any amount are
therefore necessary and appreciated.

So please consider  donating online. In the  left sidebar of
the new  website, you will  find a "Support the  DSA" block,
with a  link to our  donation page.  This will allow  you to
donate via Paypal.

It may be worth considering  a monthly donation; say, $3, or
$6, or whatever seems reasonable to  you. This can be set up
quite easily with Paypal.

Of course,  if you prefer to  donate by check, you  may send
them to our worthy Treasurer,  Jay Schiffman, payable to the
Dozenal Society of America, at:

    Jay Schiffman
    604-36 South Washington Square, #815
    Philadelphia, PA  19106-4115

As  noted above,  we pay  no  salaries, so  every penny  you
donate  goes  entirely  to  the  furtherance  of  the  DSA's
mission.

----------------------Member Benefits-----------------------

Chief  among  the benefits  of  membership,  aside from  the
knowledge  of supporting  the DSA's  mission, is  receipt of
_The  Duodecimal Bulletin_.  In  addition, however,  members
also receive (digitally) a  membership card containing their
vital  member  information  and   a  monthly  calendar  with
dozenal numbers, containing suitable and educational dozenal
quotations and graphics, laid out for wall display.

To  receive  these, please  notify  us  that you'd  like  to
receive them:

    Contact@dozenal.org

--------------------Website Improvements--------------------

We've been  able to implement the  member-site feature which
will  give  a  user his  member  information---member  type,
membership number, name, and so  forth---when he goes to the
members-only section.

Of course, this is only  available for members who create an
account at the website, a quick process which can be started
here:

    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/user/login

We're planning further improvements as time goes on.  Please
consider taking advantage of this service for members!

Further improvements  include the  final mothballing  of our
original, blue-themed website. A website visitor pointed out
that this  original site, which our  last president, Michael
deVlieger,  replaced several  years  ago, was  still up  and
functioning, though  throwing some  PHP errors.  These pages
are now  redirected to their appropriate  equivalents on our
new site.

As a result  of this, we noticed that we  had not provided a
new  version of  our mascot,  the panda,  webpage; so  we've
posted a  brief page about that  mascot on our new  site, as
well:

    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/our-mascot-panda

Charismatic megafauna are always great publicity!

-------------Anki Deck for Basic Dozenal Facts--------------

If you're having trouble remembering basic dozenal facts, or
just  haven't  had the  time  or  energy to  finally  commit
those multiplication  tables to  memory, there's  a resource
available to help:

    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/dozenal-basics-anki-deck-flash-cards

Anki is a free program  for your desktop or smartphone which
manages decks  of flash  cards for you.  This deck  for Anki
allows  you to  review your  dozenal  facts for  just a  few
minutes each day,  at your own pace, and  review those facts
which are  harder for  you more often  than those  which are
easier  for you.  It's surprising  how quickly  you'll learn
what you want to know.

Once you know  these basic dozenal facts  (the times tables;
basic dozenal  fractions, such  as 5  / 14  = 0;39;  and the
basic  divisibility  tests), you'll  be  able  to take  much
better  advantage of  the superior  dozenal system.  You may
even find yourself dreading having to use decimal.

----------------------ASEE Conference-----------------------

As noted, the DSA was privileged  to be able to to present a
workshop at  the annual  conference of the  American Society
for Engineering Education (ASEE)  in Atlanta, GA, this June.
This  was a  lengthy  and difficult  process which  involved
developing  a  program  proposal  for  the  ASEE  conference
maintainers; and, when the proposal was accepted, developing
the program and  the materials necessary to  present it. The
vast bulk of this work was done by our own Jen Seron, which,
along  with  her other  many  good  deeds for  the  Society,
rightfully earned her the recognition recounted below.

Even after the program was accepted, we were faced with many
challenges,  not least  of which  was that  the ASEE  put us
across from a program  presented by Dassault Systemes, which
was  giving away  some  rather expensive  software to  those
attending their workshop.

Despite  this, our  workshop attracted  a small  but engaged
group of lower-elementary teachers  (mostly K-6). This group
learned  the basics  of alternate  bases; some  of the  more
prominent  uses  of  alternate  bases  (binary,  octal,  and
hexadecimal primarily); and, of course, they learned about a
proposed base for human use, dozenal. Board member Dan Simon
also  spoke  about  the  Mayan base-twenty  system  and  the
Babylonian base-sixty system which  gave us a goodly portion
of our system of temporal and angular measurement.

After thus  covering the basics,  we were able to  treat the
participants  as  if  they  themselves were  members  of  an
elementary  classroom. They  designed  symbols  for ten  and
eleven,  with some  interesting results,  and discussed  the
design  principles  which  could lead  to  various  symbolic
forms.  They  asked  questions  about  good  strategies  for
teaching bases  to students, particularly  younger students,
and suggested  some good  strategies of  their own.  We were
also able  to discuss  the challenges  of teaching  bases to
anyone, particularly the young.

The materials  were prepared  primarily by board  member Dan
Simon and Secretary Jen Seron,  and are all available on our
website:

    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/educational-materials

If you happen  to be speaking to an educator,  or anyone who
works  with  students  or  children, who  is  wondering  how
to  make  math  interesting,  be  sure  to  suggest  working
with  alternative   bases,  and  to  refer   them  to  these
educational materials. They include material tailored to all
pre-collegiate math levels, and will surely be helpful.

All  in all,  the  workshop was  an unquestionable  success.
Though small, we were able to hand out a significant body of
literature and contact  information to non-participants, and
made many people aware of  the subject of alternate bases in
general,  and dozenal  in  particular,  who would  otherwise
likely never  have heard of  it. We made some  good contacts
and produced some  good publicity. Many thanks  to Jen Seron
for making it possible.

--------------------Welcome, New Member---------------------

Welcome to our newest member,  #3X9, Jose Reyes of Penuelas,
Puerto Rico! Mr. Reyes is a  student in Puerto Rico, and his
primary interests are developing suitable dozenal linguistic
constructs for  his native  language, Spanish. Feel  free to
contact him if you're interested in helping; he can be found
on the DozensOnline forum.

-----------------------Annual Meeting-----------------------

The Dozenal Society  of America held its  annual meeting for
11E9 at the Couryard by  Marriott in downtown Atlanta on 19;
June  11E9.  Present were  board  members  Gene Zirkel;  Jay
Schiffman; John  Impagliazzo; Jen Seron, Dan  Simon; and Don
Goodman. They were later joined by member Patricia Zirkel.

The meeting was extremely  productive; indeed, the board was
hard-pressed  to  finish it  within  a  reasonable time.  As
always, official minutes will be available to members of the
Society at the members-only section of this site. In lieu of
their preparation,  however, a summary of  the highlights of
the meeting will be presented here.

The  Society's   membership  system  has   been  extensively
revamped. Until recently, dues were  payable as of the first
of January  each year.  However, having had  some membership
applications stymied  by an inability  to pay dues,  and the
difficulty  and expense  of collecting  dues each  year, the
Board determined that the requirement of dues was doing more
harm than good,  and did away with it. As  of 1 January 11EX
(2014),  dues will  no  longer be  required for  membership.
Members will continue  to be entitled to  the usual benefits
of membership; however, delivery  of The Duodecimal Bulletin
will be  digital only. Those  members desiring a  paper copy
can receive one upon payment of $10; ($12.) and notification
of the  Editor. Those members  who have paid their  dues for
11E9 (2013.)  are also entitled  to a paper copy  this year,
upon notification of the Editor, whose email can be found on
our officers page.

Secretary Jen Seron, of the Oureach and Education Committee,
had  some great  ideas  for furthering  our formal  outreach
programs.  Board member  Gene  Zirkel, for  dozens of  years
a  mathematics  educator,  will  be  probing  some  contacts
in  an attempt  to  get  further programs,  or  even a  full
tract,  at  a  few  mathematics conference  next  year.  Jen
will be  researching the  possibility of  preparing physical
exhibits  regarding  dozenal  and other  alternative  bases,
including traveling math displays  as are often displayed at
universities and  museums, and the possibility  of acquiring
grants for their preparation  and production. There is great
potential here.

The year 1200; (2016.) is  approaching; this also happens to
be the 60th (72.nd) anniversary  of the incorporation of the
Dozenal Society  of America. Naturally,  this is a  big year
for us  in more ways than  one.

In  honor  of  this  event,  the DSA  is  calling  for  bids
for  the production  of  an anniversary  volume, which  will
include  selected  articles  from  our six  dozen  years  of
operation.  This  will also  include  a  great deal  of  the
"fillers"---the  Arithmetrix, the  mathematical cryptograms,
and  similar puzzles---which  have  always  given a  certain
character to the Bulletin. All with the necessary talent are
encouraged to submit a bid; if you know anyone who does this
sort of work, please encourage them to do so.

Both the Editor of the  Bulletin, Michael deVlieger, and the
Vice-President of the Society, Graham Steele, were unable to
attend  our annual  meeting  this year,  largely because  of
distance.  This sad  circumstance led  to the  determination
that more  regular means of digital  participation should be
explored. Board  member John  Impagliazzo will  be exploring
some options for this, so that more members and officers can
participate  in our  meetings, and  possibly to  enable more
frequent  meetings  in  the  future.  At  least  an  interim
solution will be available in the coming months.

Our  worthy  Treasurer  and  Chairman of  the  Board,  Prof.
Jay  Schiffman  of  Rowan University,  gave  a  presentation
on  dozenal integer  sequences,  which  was interesting  and
well-received by  all. Noting  that the  Online Encyclopedia
of  Integer  Sequences has  developed  into  an immense  and
extremely  useful resource,  Prof. Schiffman  suggested that
dozenalists  could  produce  a   similar  database  of  such
sequences  in   our  own   preferred  base,   and  presented
substantial progress in that  regard. Board member Dan Simon
was able to correct a  few minor errors in Prof. Schiffman's
figures off the cuff, which impressed all present.

President  Don Goodman  gave  a  presentation on  Systematic
Dozenal  Nomenclature, a  coherent system  for referring  to
dozenal numbers developed on the DozensOnline forum and fast
becoming, if  it has  not already become,  a sort  of lingua
franca there.  The system  was well thought  of by  all, and
should be published in detail  in the Bulletin, WN X1. Those
wishing  more  information now  can  look  on the  forum  or
explore  a set  of Don  Goodman's private  SDN pages  on the
subject:

    http://gorpub.freeshell.org/dozenal/blosxom.cgi/dozapp.html#sdn

All in  all, the Society  made great progress at  the Annual
Meeting of  11E9, and the  future holds great  potential for
us, the study  of number bases in general,  and the progress
of dozenal in  particular. Thanks to all  our membership for
your  support  throughout  the  year,  and  we  hope  you'll
continue  to support  us  as  we further  the  goals of  the
Society in the coming year.

------------------------Annual Award------------------------

The Ralph Beard Memorial Award for 11E9 was presented to our
worthy Secretary, Jen Seron, for her efforts in securing and
managing our  workshop presentation at the  American Society
for Engineering  Education conference in Atlanta  this year,
and for  her other contributions.  For this effort,  and for
her other efforts,  Jen is most deserving of  the Award, and
we are all grateful for her contributions.

Such formal  educational outreach has  not been done  by the
Society  for some  time,  and Jen  deserves  a dozen  Annual
Awards for making it happen. Congratulations, Jen, and thank
you.

---------------------Tax-Exempt Status----------------------

As many of you know, due  to a change in IRS regulations the
DSA lost  its tax-exempt status.  This was largely  an issue
with a small  part of our Articles of  Incorporation. In the
process of fixing this issue, we were able to do a good deal
of housecleaning of our Articles  and our paperwork with the
IRS; for  example, the DSA  actually had not one,  but *two*
equally valid IRS identification numbers!

The  problem with  our  Articles is  resolved,  and we  have
submitted all the necessary paperwork and fees for restoring
our  tax-exempt  status. While  we  are  not yet  officially
tax-exempt again, we are well on our way, and will hopefully
have this issue behind us before the end of the year.

--------------------Bulletin Publication--------------------

Many  of  you have  undoubtedly  noticed  that our  Bulletin
has  not  been  published  since 11E6  (2010.).  After  some
conversation with  our Editor, we  have decided that  we are
able to  resume publication very shortly.  Expect two issues
this year, and at least two next year. We apologize for this
delay.

============================================================
=                    POETICAL DIVERSION                    =
============================================================

Thus  far our  Poetical Diversions  have mostly  been larks,
ham-fisted,  tongue-in-cheek  redoes  of  famous  poems  and
structures. For example, we've  seen a dozenal Shakespearean
sonnet   (Newscast  01:02),   a   dozenal   version  of   Le
Marseillaise  (Newscast 01:03),  and  a  dozenal version  of
Walt  Whitman's elegy  for Abraham  Lincoln, "O  Captain! My
Captain!"  (Newscast 01:04).  These are  diverting at  best,
little use beyond entertainment.

However, it seems useful to reform some of our current poems
and rhymes  dealing with  decimal numbers  to be  useful for
dozenal, or even  to compose new ones; we've  done that with
one  simple  rhyme this  month.  Readers  are encouraged  to
provide us with  more; or, indeed, anything  they would like
fellow DSA members to see.

This is  intended to  be useful for  elementary-age children
learning  the basics  of arithmetic.  They won't  understand
everything about it (the cubes  and squares, likely), but it
will serve them well in remembering the traits of the single
digits, and will be useful to them as they advance.

Of course, adults may find it helpful, as well.

           THE NUMBER RHYME

One is the first; it's a single straight line;
Two is a couple, the sole even prime;
Three is a few, and a quarter of twelve;
Four is a third, and twice two if you delve;
Five is the fifth, 'tween a third and a half;
Six's a half-dozen!  We're well on our path!
Seven's just less than two-thirds, through the door;
Eight is two-thirds and two cubed and twice four;
Nine is three-quarters, three threes, and three squared; 
Ten is twice five; nearly through have we dared!
Eleven is prime, and it's one less than done;
Then twelve, unqua, dozen, as bright as as the sun!
    Twice six, three fours, four threes, and six twos,
    A dozen has factors that we all can use;
    The lowest abundant, the dozen's so grand,
    Let everyone learn it, throughout all the land!

This rhyme is available as a typeset pdf on our website:

============================================================
=               DOZENAL THOUGHT OF THE MONTH               =
============================================================

When discussing  the purpose  of our  Society at  our annual
meeting,  it  was brought  up  that  studying number  bases,
including dozenal, isn't  just for the nerdy  pleasure of it
all (though  there's plenty  of that),  nor for  the dozenal
evangelism (though  there's good  room for that,  too). It's
also immensely  helpful for just understanding  *what number
is* and *how number works*.

Too  often,  we  learn   about  writing  numbers  and  doing
arithmetic on  them as a  set of magical incantations  to be
cast  at scrawls  of smudged  pencil on  college-ruled paper
torn out  of spiral notebooks---or  as simply buttons  to be
pressed on the  inscrutable black boxes that do  most of our
number-crunching  these  days.  But  why  our  numbers  mean
what they  do, why  our arithmetical algorithms  produce the
right  answers;  these  are  questions that  deserve  to  be
answered, and  that should  be well  understood in  a really
numerate society. They are also questions that only studying
alternate bases can effectively answer.

So the next  time someone asks you why  you're so interested
in such a geeky subject, if  you're like many of us, you can
tell them  the truth:  you didn't really  understand numbers
until you learned about other  bases. And when you did learn
about other  bases, and you  did start to  really understand
numbers, math  was no longer  a boring topic. It  might help
others to understand.

                    EACH ONE, TEACH ONE
