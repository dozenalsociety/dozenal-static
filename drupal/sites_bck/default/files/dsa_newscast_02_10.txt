============================================================

Members,  please  remember that  while  dues  are no  longer
required for membership, we still  rely on the generosity of
members  to keep  the DSA  going. Donations  of any  amount,
large or small, are welcome and needed.

A  donation   of  $10;  ($12.)  will   procure  Subscription
membership, and entitles the payer to receive both a digital
and  a paper  copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other
members will  receive only  a digital  copy. To  invoke this
privilege, please  notify the  Editor of the  Bulletin, Mike

----------------------Member Benefits-----------------------

Chief  among  the benefits  of  membership,  aside from  the
knowledge  of supporting  the DSA's  mission, is  receipt of
_The  Duodecimal Bulletin_.  In  addition, however,  members
also receive (digitally) a  membership card containing their
vital  member  information  and   a  monthly  calendar  with
dozenal numbers, containing suitable and educational dozenal
quotations and graphics, laid out for wall display.

Member (and newly elected board member) John Volan has drawn
our attention to a wondeful  video on some of the advantages
of dozenal by Adam Hoek:

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVk_viJEDII

Emphasizing the  importance of the number  three, this video
is a great advertisement for dozenal.

Indeed, it  turns out  that there are  a great  many dozenal
videos on Youtube, many of  which are quite worth the watch.
Some examples:

    Numberphile on Base 12:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6xjfP7-HCc
    Adam Victor on Dozenal Hand Signs:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssK9pTyK1C0
    Ron Israeli on The Duodecimal system advantage
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXCAevjNva0 (Part 1)
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Anh_IHokV7M (Part 2)
    Huylebrouck on Base 12 counting:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs6w2yf7WDk

It  is  also  worthwhile  searching for  dozenal  videos  by
Ben  Crowder and  Adam Harbaugh,  who have  videos on  doing
arithmetic in our favorite base.

A number of dozenal articles have also come to our attention
over the past month:

    "Dozen make sense" by Mary Jackson:
        http://www.newenglishreview.org/blog_comment.cfm/blog_id/28222/Dozen-make-sense

    "For Math-Heads and Policy Wonks  Only -- Popcorn by the
    Colonel #66B"
        http://middletowneyenews.blogspot.com/2013/10/for-math-heads-and-policy-wonks-only.html
    
    (In German):  "Duodezimal - Rechnen mit der Basis 12"
        http://www.duodezimal.de

The  DSA  has not  been  idle,  either;  we are  pleased  to
announce  the  publication  of  another  historical  dozenal
article, excerpted from a larger work on arithmetic:

    "A Duodecimal Scale", by Dr. Edward Brooks
        http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/duodecimal-scale

This work is  short but sweet, detailing one  of the earlier
complete proposals for a  dozenal system. Readers interested
in the  historical development of dozenalism  will notice in
it the roots of the dozenal systems of Dr. Sydney Reeves and
Rev. Thomas Freeman.

-----------------------Annual Meeting-----------------------

The  DSA had  a very  successful annual  meeting this  year,
well-attended and very interesting.

We gathered at the Apple  Boardroom at the Richmond Marriott
on Friday, 12 November, while the Regional Conference of the
National Conference of Teachers  of Mathematics continued in
the rooms  around us.  Present were  Gene Zirkel  (#67); Jay
Schiffman (#2X8);  Donald Goodman (#398); Jen  Seron (#3A2);
Dan Simon (#395); Timothy Travis (#342); and Pat Zirkel.

Attending  digitally was  newly  elected  Board Member  John
Volan  (#418),  who was  good  enough  to  join us  for  the
duration of both the board and membership meetings. This was
our first attempt at video conferencing, put together at the
very last minute and requiring some extra equipment (also at
the last minute)  from the hotel, and ended  up working very
well. John has agreed to explore the possibility of allowing
video  conferencing on  a  larger scale  in  the future,  so
hopefully we will  be able to have more  members attend this
way for our 59th annual meeting next year.

Also attending  for several hours  by phone was  our Editor,
Michael deVlieger (#37E), who was  able to give us an update
on  our Bulletin  as well  as  make a  proposal for  Dozenal
Consensus Numerals, about which more later.

The  routine matters  of our  board and  membership meetings
went by  quickly. The Board  of Directors Class of  1201 was
elected without incident,  as was the slate  of officers and
the board appointments.

Newly  seated  board  member John  Volan  suggested  further
digital  outreach,   via  our   website  and   for  meetings
between  members. He  suggested  perhaps  a regular  digital
meetup  by  video  conference---Skype or  Google  Talk  were
possibilities---to  allow  members   to  interact  with  one
another and to spread ideas.  Perhaps a planned talk on some
topic of  interest on  dozenals or other  non-decimal bases,
followed by  discussions from participating members  on that
topic. Some  of these  talks could  perhaps be  recorded and
made videos, podcasts, or both available on our website.

He  also  pointed  out  some  excellent  dozenal  multimedia
content available on  Youtube, and wondered why  the DSA had
not been  part of  producing this material.  Members present
agreed that we should be part of this. He suggested outreach
and recruitment  on the  makers of  many of  these excellent
videos (many  of which are linked  to in this issue  of your
Newscast), and members agreed that we should explore ways of
sponsoring or producing such content.

Member Timothy Travis, in  particular, spoke about the power
of elegant  and well-designed  graphics, and  Mike deVlieger
noted that John  Volan's voice and his  visual design skills
could be a powerful combination.

Secretary Jen  Seron spoke  about the  DSA's session  at the
NCTM Regional Conference the day before. (See below for more
information that.) Chairman and Treasurer Jay Schiffman also
described the program that he  and Editor Mike deVlieger put
on  at  another  NCTM Regional  Conference  in  Indianapolis
several weeks before. We  agreed that these conferences held
potential for our outreach  and education missions; and that
though they were absorbing an  unusually large amount of our
funding, this potential was  worth our continuing to attempt
doing them for at least the next few years.

Editor  Mike deVlieger  informed us  that he  has plenty  of
material  for  the next  Bulletin  and  will be  putting  it
together over  the next month or  two. If all goes  well, we
will  have another  issue around  the  end of  the year.  He
briefly described some of the  material it will contain; but
we won't put any spoilers here.

Members discussed and agreed that our next meeting should be
somewhere in  the southern Midwest, likely  Cincinnati. More
details will be announced as  plans firm up. Our 60th Annual
Meeting two years from now will  be in St. Louis, MO. As the
gateway to the West, long an American symbol of progress and
improvement, this provides a  perfect location for the start
of the 12th biquennium.

Mike  deVlieger  made  a   proposal  for  Dozenal  Consensus
Numerals  in  the  coming   biquennium  (starting  in  1200;
(2016.)). He  noted that  the Pitman dozenal  numerals (long
used by the Dozenal Society of Great Britain, and consisting
of an inverted  two and three) were due to  be accepted into
Unicode (in  positions U+218A and U+218B)  in 1200; (2016.).
We will, of course, notice that  this just happens to be the
year of the big dozenal  extravaganza that the DSA is hoping
to plan in  honor of its 60th anniversary  and the beginning
of the 12th biquennium.

Mike  proposed  this as  a  powerful  argument in  favor  of
adopting  these numerals,  as  they are  the *only*  dozenal
numerals  available   in  Unicode.  Gene  Zirkel   was  more
skeptical,  noting  that  the  DSA  had  departed  from  its
longstanding Dwiggins numerals once  before, in favor of the
Bell numerals,  and it  had been an  unquestionable failure.
The  decision was  made to  table the  issue until  our next
Annual Meeting  and put the  issue to the membership  in the
interim; the board can then  take this input into account in
making  its decision.  Members  should expect  to here  more
about this in the near future.

These important issues discussed,  the members present voted
unanimously to adjourn and retired for dinner and fellowship
together, wrapping up a successful and productive meeting.

--------------------Presentation at NCTM--------------------

The  DSA also  gave  two presentations  this  year, both  at
regional conferences of the  National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics; the  first in Indianapolis, IN,  and the second
in Richmond, VA.

In Indianapolis,  Editor Michael deVlieger (#37E)  and Board
Chairman Jay  Schiffman (#2X8) presented a  program to about
half a dozen interested  participants. Readers interested in
knowing more are encouraged to request it from them.

In  Richmond, Donald  Goodman  (#398),  Secretary Jen  Seron
(3X2), and Board Member Dan Simon (#395) presented a program
on alternate bases to another half dozen or so participants.
Despite  being opposite  from  very  strong programs,  these
participants  expressed great  interest, several  mentioning
that they had never really  heard of the concept before. One
graduate student specifically  expressed interest in joining
the Society, as did a  professor; the student stated she was
especially  interested in  Mike deVlieger's  "Multiplication
Tables in Various Bases."

All  in all,  while our  presentations weren't  particularly
well  attended,  those  who  did  attend  showed  a  lot  of
interest,  and we  were able  to distribute  a good  deal of
literature  and awareness  of our  Society and  its mission.
They must thus be classified as successes.

------------------------Our Website-------------------------

The close of the year seems to merit a review of some of our
biggest outreaches. Other than our meeting and presentation,
our most important outreach is our website.

Our website continues  to generate a great  deal of traffic,
as  well as  attract a  great many  members. Since  our last
annual meeting, we have received 64 new members (and welcome
to all of  them); all but one of these  has been through the
website.  This  alone  should  qualify  the  endeavor  as  a
success.

In  other  metrics,  the  website's  exposure  continues  to
improve. Since our last update  in February, our traffic has
been mostly steady, but with  a slight upward slant. We went
from  a low  of about  70  views per  day in  August to  our
current average of about X0 per day, with some days going up
to 17E and  a few as low  as 38. These low  days have become
less  and less  common and  the higher  days more  and more.
There was  a huge spike  40E views  on 3 April,  for reasons
that  I simply  can't determine,  and smaller  spikes on  18
June, 1X July, and 25-26 September.

Our top pages  are mostly category pages,  such as "Articles
and Books" and "Educational Materials." This latter contains
the materials used in our  presentations both in Atlanta and
in  Richmond this  year, and  it is  the third  most popular
page  on  our site.  For  individual  articles, by  far  the
most  popular are  "Fundamentals Operations  in the  Dozenal
System"  and "A  Brief  Introduction  to Dozenal  Counting,"
which  are  flying off  the  digital  shelves. Also  popular
is  James  Malone's  classic,  "Eggsactly  a  Dozenal,"  and
Mike  deVlieger's  "Multiplication   in  Base  Twelve."  Our
"Practice Your Dozenal Arithmetic Page" is quite popular, as
is  "Decimal-Dozenal  Conversion  Rules."  Mike  deVlieger's
"Multiplication Tables of Various  Bases" remains quite high
on the list,  as well, and Michael  Punter's "ZCaculator" is
getting a large number of downloads.

Our  visitors come  predominantly  from  the United  States;
the  United Kingdom  and  Canada  are nearly  neck-and-neck.
Surprisingly, Germany, Sweden, and  France are also frequent
visitors, with  Australia unsurprisingly  in the  mix. We're
also seeing significant numbers from  the other parts of the
EU, South Korea, Russia, New Zealand, and the Philippines.

Most users find our website by searching for the predictable
terms:  "dozenal,"  "dozenal  society," and  "base  12"  are
the  three most  common. We're  getting more  and more  from
"duodecimal," and  we're also getting hits  from individuals
seeking  specific  tools,   like  "dozenal  calculator"  and
"dozenal clock."  Aside from search engines,  many users are
finding us from the  Wikipedia article "Duodecimal" and from
the io9 article "Why We  Should Switch to a Base-12 Counting
System," among other less  common sources. Surprisingly, one
of  our more  common referers  is a  Korean site,  ilbe.com;
Google Translate indicates is a news aggregator.

Our  website  remains  a  powerful  tool  for  bringing  our
message to the world, and thereby fulfilling our educational
mission. Thanks  to everyone who  helps make it what  it is,
especially our many  great writers, who give  us the content
that all these users are coming for.
