============================================================

Members,  please  remember that  while  dues  are no  longer
required for membership, we still  rely on the generosity of
members  to keep  the DSA  going. Donations  of any  amount,
large or small, are welcome and needed.

A  donation   of  $10;  ($12.)  will   procure  Subscription
membership, and entitles the payer to receive both a digital
and  a paper  copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other
members will  receive only  a digital  copy. To  invoke this
privilege, please  notify the  Editor of the  Bulletin, Mike
deVlieger, at

    mdevlieger@dozenal.org

As members know, we are  a volunteer organization which pays
no salaries.  As such,  every penny  you donate  goes toward
furthering the DSA's goals.

It may be worth considering  a monthly donation; say, $3, or
$6, or whatever seems reasonable to  you. This can be set up
quite  easily  with  Paypal  or WePay,  both  of  which  are
available at our web site.

Of course,  if you prefer to  donate by check, you  may send
them to our worthy Treasurer,  Jay Schiffman, payable to the
Dozenal Society of America, at:

    Jay Schiffman
    604-36 South Washington Square, #815
    Philadelphia, PA  19106-4115

----------------------Member Benefits-----------------------

Chief  among  the benefits  of  membership,  aside from  the
knowledge  of supporting  the DSA's  mission, is  receipt of
_The  Duodecimal Bulletin_.  In  addition, however,  members
also receive (digitally) a  membership card containing their
vital  member  information  and   a  monthly  calendar  with
dozenal numbers, containing suitable and educational dozenal
quotations and graphics, laid out for wall display.

To  receive  these, please  notify  us  that you'd  like  to
receive them:

=                         FOR SALE                         =
============================================================

The DSA  is pleased to  offer the following for  sale. These
are all either at cost, or the proceeds go to the Society.

    Wall Calendar for 11EX (stapled binding)      $11.60
    Wall Calendar for 11EX, coiled binding        $16.70
    Weekly Planner for 11EX                       $11.29
    TGM:  A Coherent Dozenal Metrology             $8.00

Prices are,  unfortunately but by necessity,  in decimal. To
find these works, simply go to:

    http://www.lulu.com/shop/shop.ep

and enter the appropriate  terms. E.g., searching for "11EX"
will turn up these calendars  and the planner; searching for
"TGM dozenal" will turn up the TGM book.

We hope  to offer  other titles, and  even some  other items
(such as dozenal clocks and the like), in the near future.

=                   LIVING DOZENS:  AGES                   =
============================================================

We all have  ages, and these are always numbers;  so why not
think about our ages in dozens?

If  you've just  turned thirty,  you're 26;  if you've  just
turned forty,  you're 34. You're  legally an adult at  16 (a
much nicer number  in base twelve than in base  ten, an even
dozen and  a half).  You can legally  consume alcohol  at 19
(just  as clumsy  in  dozenal as  in  decimal, I'm  afraid).
You're a senior citizen at only 55 (perhaps, in keeping with
our current trends,  make this 56 so it's even);  and if you
manage to live to 100, you're setting some real records.

We  refer  to  people  who  are  still  in  their  twenties,
thirties,  etc., and  of course  such sayings  will have  to
be  altered. However,  these  sayings make  more sense  when
in  dozens,  anyway.  Do  we  not  regularly  refer  to  the
"eighteen  to thirty"  demographic? Does  this not  work out
much more nicely in dozenal,  with a "16 to 26" demographic?
Fortunately, thirty and 26 work pretty well in both systems,
since that's the  age at which we stop  being "young adults"
and become simply "adults."

For infants,  of course,  this is  nothing less  than common
sense. We  already speak of  infants' ages in  months, after
all, of which  there are twelve in a year.  It's easy to say
that an  infant is 16 months  old, knowing that he's  a year
and a  half. And  this month  system comes  in handy  at all
ages, too; it's  easy to tell when we are  halfway through a
year, or a quarter, or a third, or a sixth, while in decimal
this can require much more thought.

This is a small thing; but it helps to get us used to really
*thinking* in dozens, as well as gives us some practice with
dozenal numbers.

Brian  Hetrick  (#426)  has  authored  a  dozenal  clock  in
.NET  2.0 compatible  with Windows  computers and  GNU/Linux
computers with the Mono environment installed:

    http://www.brianhetrick.com/gplsw/index.html

The program  is free software (AGPL  licensed) and available
for download at the above link.  It displays the time in our
decimal/sexagesimal system as well  as in dozenal, in duors,
"dinits," and "deconds."

Jim  Zamerski (#42E)  sends us  a composition  based on  the
dozen digits  of pi, which  is by some margin  the loveliest
your editor has ever heard:

These musical representations of transcendental numbers have
gotten pretty  common; indeed,  the On-Line  Encyclopedia of
Integer Sequences (http://www.oeis.org) can turn any integer
sequence  into  music.  But  this rendition  really  has  an
uncommonly  beautiful result---at  least,  in your  editor's
opinion. Another video includes melodies for Euler's number,
2pi, and  raw notes for  the Golden Ratio (phi),  along with
sheet music for pi:

Speaking on the OEIS, Jay  Schiffman (our Board Chairman and
Treasurer, #2X8)  spoke on dozenal integer  sequences at our
last annual meeting, and noted  that a dozenal version would
be useful. Thanks to James  Wood, a neighbor across the pond
in Yorkshire,  England, anyone  running a Firefox  or Chrome
browser has one!

    http://www.userscripts.org/scripts/show/103812
    http://www.userscripts.org/scripts/show/175429

This scripts can be easily  loaded into the above or similar
browsers and cause the OEIS to produce its integer sequences
in  dozenal  as well  as  decimal;  the second  even  allows
*searching* the  database for  dozenal sequences. This  is a
great tool for dozenal research.

============================================================

This issue  was delayed due  to your Board having  a meeting
scheduled  for  2  April   11EX,  which  would  decide  some
significant matters. Fortunately, this meeting occurred, and
a great deal of useful progress was made.

-----------------------Annual Meeting-----------------------

Our annual meeting  will be held on 13;  (15.) November 11EX
in Richmond,  Virginia. Further details (such  as the hotel,
exact  times,  and agenda)  will  be  provided as  they  are
finalized.

----------------------NCTM Conference-----------------------

As noted before,  our proposal to present a  workshop at the
regional  meeting of  the  National Council  of Teachers  of
Mathematics  in  Richmond,  Virginia  was  accepted.  Thanks
again to  our Secretary, Jen  Seron, and our  Treasurer, Jay
Schiffman, for a  great deal of hard work  in preparing that
proposal and paving the way for its acceptance.

That conference takes place 11-12; (13-14.) November, so our
annual meeting will immediately follow the conference. We've
not  yet been  told which  of  those two  days will  contain
our  workshop; this  information will  be included  in later
Newscasts as it becomes available.

--------------New Newscast Delivery Mechanism---------------

Our burgeoning membership has taxed our formerly slap-dashed
means of  delivering _The  DSA Newscast_ to  our membership;
this Google  group is  an attempt  to resolve  that problem.
Transitioning to this method may involve some growing pains,
for which we apologize and ask for your kind patience.

                     Twelve's My Number

I try to do up my sums;
I'm multiplying some nums;
but still I'm only thumbs,
'cause ten is in my way;

I'd trade this ten for an ace, 
a better number as base,
some fleeter feet for this race;
ten is just in my way!

But twelve's my winner;
clean thirds, quarters thinner;
fifths tough; but five's a sinner;
abundant factors to save the day!

(chorus)

Hey, when I met you,
I went crazy!
'Cause twelve's my number;
I don't mean maybe!

So many factors,
I need no more!
So twelve's my number;
I don't mean maybe!

(To be  sung to  the tune  of "Call Me  Maybe" by  Carly Rae
Jepsen, if you can stomach  it, with tongue placed firmly in
cheek.)
