============================================================

Members,  please  remember that  while  dues  are no  longer
required for membership, we still  rely on the generosity of
members  to keep  the DSA  going. Donations  of any  amount,
large or small, are welcome and needed.

A  donation   of  $10;  ($12.)  will   procure  Subscription
membership, and entitles the payer to receive both a digital
and  a paper  copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other
members will  receive only  a digital  copy. To  invoke this
privilege, please  notify the  Editor of the  Bulletin, Mike
deVlieger, at

    mdevlieger@dozenal.org

As members know, we are  a volunteer organization which pays
no salaries.  As such,  every penny  you donate  goes toward
furthering the DSA's goals.

It may be worth considering  a monthly donation; say, $3, or
$6, or whatever seems reasonable to  you. This can be set up
quite  easily  with  Paypal  or WePay,  both  of  which  are
available at our web site.

Of course,  if you prefer to  donate by check, you  may send
them to our worthy Treasurer,  Jay Schiffman, payable to the
Dozenal Society of America, at:

    Jay Schiffman
    604-36 South Washington Square, #815
    Philadelphia, PA  19106-4115

Remember, too, that as of last month, the DSA is a 501(c)(3)
tax-exempt organization,  so your  contributions may  be tax
deductible under applicable law.

----------------------Member Benefits-----------------------

Chief  among  the benefits  of  membership,  aside from  the
knowledge  of supporting  the DSA's  mission, is  receipt of
_The  Duodecimal Bulletin_.  In  addition, however,  members
also receive (digitally) a  membership card containing their
vital  member  information  and   a  monthly  calendar  with
dozenal numbers, containing suitable and educational dozenal
quotations and graphics, laid out for wall display.

To  receive  these, please  notify  us  that you'd  like  to
receive them:

    Contact@dozenal.org

The DSA  is pleased to  offer the following for  sale. These

will turn up these calendars  and the planner; searching for
"TGM dozenal" will turn up the TGM book.

We hope  to offer  other titles, and  even some  other items
(such as dozenal clocks and the like), in the near future.

------------Dozenal Android Apps Now Available--------------

As announced last month, the DSA has released three apps for
the Android mobile operating system. These apps make it even
easier to work  with dozenal on a daily  basis. The released
apps are:

    -DozclockWidget:  A  dozenal  clock,  which  provides  a
    dozenalized  version  of  our current  time,  each  hour
    divided into 100; units. This app also shows the date in
    dozenal.  Best of  all, it  can be  used as  a *widget*,
    meaning that it can reside comfortably on your screen at
    all times,  so that you  never have  to open it  and can
    have the  dozenal time  at your fingertips  whenever you
    want it.

    -dozbc: A dozenal calculator,  capable of the usual four
    functions, roots, powers,  grouping via parentheses, and
    rudimentary memory functions.

    -TGMDroid:  A  metric  converter,  working  entirely  in
    dozenal; this  converts from SI,  English/customary, and
    the dozenal system known as TGM.

Also forthcoming is a dozenal  calendar app, which will keep
appointments by date  and time in dozenal. This  is still in
alpha stages and will be released at a later time.

---------------Assistance Needed for iOS Apps---------------

If you are  able to program or learn to  program for the iOS
operating  system  used  on Apple  mobile  products,  please
contact us  if you'd  be willing to  create apps  similar to
those above,  or additional apps  which might be  useful and
interesting to members of the DSA, for iOS.

-------------Spanish-Language Dozenal Materials-------------

The  DSA is  pleased to  announce the  availability of  some
Spanish-language dozenal material on its website; and what's
more, that material is even historical. Originally published
in 1098; (1844.), D. Vincente  Pujals de la Bastida provided
a lengthy and convincing defense of the dozen as a system of
numeration in his book, Filosofia de la Numeracion:

    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/filosofia-de-la-numeracion

Completely  retypeset, with  a  large  number of  compelling
tables  and   two  figures,  this  book   provides  a  great
introduction   to  number   systems  and   dozenal.  Because
translating such a work is beyond the abilities of anyone in
the Society currently volunteering,  it is offered here only
in  its  original  language,  Spanish.  We  have  also  made
available  an excerpt  explaining why  we should  prefer the
dozen over other bases:

    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/de-la-numeracion-que-debe-preferirse

We now  have materials on  our website in  English, Spanish,
French, and Esperanto; this work will help spread dozenal to
new audiences throughout the world.

============================================================

For  many years,  the DSA  has been  employing the  Dwiggins
numerals (a stylized X and E) for the numbers ten and eleven
in our publications. We have never *endorsed* any particular
set of numerals, but we have used these as a standard in our
own works.

At the Annual  Meeting in 11EX, the Editor  of the Bulletin,
Michael deVlieger, made  a proposal that we  cease using the
Dwiggins numerals  and begin  using the Pitman  numerals (an
inverted 2 and  3). Before making such  a decision, however,
your  board wanted  to  inquire into  the  positions of  our
membership.

The  argument against  switching to  the Pitman  numerals is
essentially one  of consistency.  We have used  the Dwiggins
numerals for  most of our 6  dozen years (for around  two to
three dozen  we used  the asterisk  and octothorpe,  or Bell
numerals), and consistency with that tradition is important.

The  argument  for  switching  to  the  Pitman  numerals  is
twofold:

    1.) Uniformity with the  practice of the Dozenal Society
    of Great Britain.

    2.)  To take  advantage of  the addition  of the  Pitman
    numerals to the worldwide standard known as Unicode.

The  Pitman  numerals,  described   as  "turned  digit  two"
and  "turned  digit  three",   have  been  accepted  by  the
International Unicode Consortium and will be included in the
standard sometime next year (the year 1200). This would mean
that, for the  first time in our  history, dozenalists would
not  have to  constantly devise  their own  symbols for  the
transdecimal digits. These two symbols, recognized as digits
and  not  as letters,  would  be  part of  an  international
standard; font designers would likely begin including glyphs
for  these symbols  in  their fonts;  word processors,  text
editors, and the like  could begin including recognition for
these characters; and so forth.

Are these arguments sufficient to justify departing from the
DSA's long  tradition? Please  let us  know your  opinion by
writing to:

    newscast@dozenal.org

In a  few days, we'll  be putting a  poll on the  website to
allow our membership to make  an vote on symbols and provide
some comments to explain their opinions.

Please  note, however,  that  the DSA  is *not*  considering
endorsing  any  particular set  of  symbols;  we are  simply
deciding on whether to retain our current consensus numerals
for purposes of our publications, or to change to the Pitman
numerals.  We  are  not  holding a  referendum  on  favorite
symbols, only trying  to determine which of  two sets should
be the default in our publications.

Thank you in advance for your input.

May auld decimal be forgot,
and never brought to mind!
May auld decimal be forgot,
and dozenal come rise!

    For dozenal should rise, my jo,
    for dozenal should rise!
    We'll see the fall of dec'mal yet,
    and dozenal shall rise!

And surely you'll buy your pint-cup,
and surely I'll buy mine!
In packs of six and twelve we'll drink,
to dozenal's near rise!

    For dozenal should rise, my jo,
    for dozenal should rise!
    We'll see the fall of dec'mal yet,
    and dozenal shall rise!

And there's a hand, my trusty friend,
and give a hand o' thine!
Five fingers, but twelve joints are there,
for auld lang syne!
    
    For dozenal should rise, my jo,
    for dozenal should rise!
    We'll see the fall of dec'mal yet,
    and dozenal shall rise!

O decimal must fall soon or late,
as weak must fall to strong!
For twelve is favored by ol' Fate,
and it shall rise ere long!

    For dozenal should rise, my jo,
    for dozenal should rise!
    We'll see the fall of dec'mal yet,
    and dozenal shall rise!
