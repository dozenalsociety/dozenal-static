============================================================

Members,  please  remember that  while  dues  are no  longer
required for membership, we still  rely on the generosity of
members  to keep  the DSA  going. Donations  of any  amount,
large or small, are welcome and needed.

A  donation   of  $10;  ($12.)  will   procure  Subscription
membership, and entitles the payer to receive both a digital
and  a paper  copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other
members will  receive only  a digital  copy. To  invoke this
privilege, please  notify the  Editor of the  Bulletin, Mike
deVlieger, at

    mdevlieger@dozenal.org

As members know, we are  a volunteer organization which pays
no salaries.  As such,  every penny  you donate  goes toward
furthering the DSA's goals.

It may be worth considering  a monthly donation; say, $3, or
$6, or whatever seems reasonable to  you. This can be set up
quite  easily  with  Paypal  or WePay,  both  of  which  are
available at our web site.

Of course,  if you prefer to  donate by check, you  may send
them to our worthy Treasurer,  Jay Schiffman, payable to the
Dozenal Society of America, at:

    Jay Schiffman
    604-36 South Washington Square, #815
    Philadelphia, PA  19106-4115

----------------------Member Benefits-----------------------

Chief  among  the benefits  of  membership,  aside from  the
knowledge  of supporting  the DSA's  mission, is  receipt of
_The  Duodecimal Bulletin_.  In  addition, however,  members
also receive (digitally) a  membership card containing their
vital  member  information  and   a  monthly  calendar  with
dozenal numbers, containing suitable and educational dozenal
quotations and graphics, laid out for wall display.

To  receive  these, please  notify  us  that you'd  like  to
receive them:

The DSA  is pleased to  offer the following for  sale. These
are all either at cost, or the proceeds go to the Society.

    Wall Calendar for 11EX (stapled binding)      $11.60
    Wall Calendar for 11EX, coiled binding        $16.70
    Weekly Planner for 11EX                       $11.29
    TGM:  A Coherent Dozenal Metrology             $8.00

Prices are,  unfortunately but by necessity,  in decimal. To
find these works, simply go to:

    http://www.lulu.com/shop/shop.ep

and enter the appropriate  terms. E.g., searching for "11EX"
will turn up these calendars  and the planner; searching for
"TGM dozenal" will turn up the TGM book.

We hope  to offer  other titles, and  even some  other items
(such as dozenal clocks and the like), in the near future.

Our  esteemed   editor,  Michael  De  Vlieger   (#37E),  has
submitted three new sequences  to the Online Encyclopedia of
Integer Sequences (OEIS), and  greatly extended another. The
following is Mike's own words on these contributions.

Two new OEIS sequences associated  with the neutral digits m
of base n.  A neutral digit m  < n neither divides  n nor is
coprime to n.  These are counted by  a pre-existing sequence
A045763, which Mike has extended to 10,000 values from 1000.

Sequence  A243822 lists  the smallest  10,000 values  of the
semidivisor counting  function. A  semidivisor is  a regular
digit m  < n that  does not divide  base n. A  regular digit
(counted by pre-existing A010846) is one, all of whose prime
divisors  p also  divide  the  base n.  Dozenal  {8, 9}  are
semidivisors, while {1,  2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9,  10;} are dozenal
regular.  Thus  A010846  -  A000005  (the  divisor  counting
function) = A243822.

Sequence  A243823 lists  the smallest  10,000 values  of the
semitotative counting function. A  semitotative is a product
of at least one prime divisor p of n and one prime q coprime
to n. Thus A045763 = A243822 + A243823. Dozenal digit ten is
a semitotative; in  base ten, 6 is  semitotative. During the
consideration  of these  neutral digit  functions, Mike  has
extended the  sequences A010846  and A105110.  The sequences
were generated by Mathematica scripts.

The two types of neutral digit derive from a 2011 proof Mike
wrote.  There  are  four  digit  types,  divisor,  totative,
semidivisor, and semitotative; with  these it is possible to
understand  a  number  base  more  clearly,  simply  by  the
behavior of its digits.

Further  sequences  under review  have  to  do with  regular
digits. These regular digits m of base n have unit fractions
that terminate in base n. An example is decimal 4 or dozenal
9:  decimal 1/4  =  .25  and dozenal  1/9  is .14.  Proposed
sequence A244052 lists bases m  which set a record number of
regular digits. (It is the record transform of A010846). The
function is similar to the highly composite numbers A002182.
These bases  have more regular digits  (whose unit fractions
have a terminating expansion in that base) than the previous
base: {2, 4, 6,  10, 12, 18, 24, 30, 42,  60, ...}. Mike has
generated  53  terms (up  to  base  53130)  at the  time  of
writing.  Finally, the  values associated  with these  bases
constitute proposed sequence A244053.

Unfortunately,  we've   still  received  no   more  definite
information for  when in  the Richmond conference  the DSA's
program  will  be   set,  so  we're  unable   to  give  more
definite information about  the date and time  of our annual
conference.  We will  share  more details  as  soon as  they
become available.

Why hot dogs buns still come in tens,
    but hot dogs come in only eight
will ever be a mystery to me;

And why does sausage come in fives,
    and cats possess a full nine lives,
but golf balls come in tins of only three?

And why's a sibling one degree,
    A parent's sibling's son full three,
but mother's sister's daughter's still my cousin?

So many numbers!  But don't fret;
    If we need more, then more we'll get;
But everything's still cheaper by the dozen!
