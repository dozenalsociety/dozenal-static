=              REFLECTIONS ON OUR FIRST YEAR               =
============================================================

Here  we are  at  the end  of  our first  year  of _The  DSA
Newscast_. We had only X issues this year, because our first
was in March, but overall  the idea of a monthly newsletter,
to provide our members with more frequent information on the
progress  and  work  of  the DSA  than  our  _Bulletin_  can
provide, seems to have been a great success.

We have had some feedback, and  all of it has been positive.
The goals of the Newscast when we started out were modest:

    Our purpose  is similarly simple: to  provide a more
    regular and  more down-to-earth publication  for the
    world  of  dozenals  than  is  currently  available.
    The  Newscast  is  *not* intended  as  a  substitute
    or  replacement   for  _The   Duodecimal  Bulletin_;
    the  purposes  of  the two  publications  are  quite
    different.
    ...
    This   little  newsletter   is  for   minor  things,
    things  too   small  or  brief   or  inconsequential
    for  the  _Bulletin_;  or,  conversely,  things  too
    time-sensitive  or  urgent  to  wait  for  the  next
    _Bulletin_.

And so it has been.

For the new year, we urge our membership to make further use
of the Newscast. Have a  little thought about dozenals you'd
like  to  share,  but  don't  want  to  write  up  a  formal
article?  Read an  article  relevant to  dozenals? Write  to
newscast@dozenal.org and share it;  if it interested you, it
would likely interest other members, as well.

In closing, thanks for making the Newscast a success; have a
wonderful year's end, and we will meet again next month.

============================================================

Members,  please  remember that  while  dues  are no  longer
required for membership, we still  rely on the generosity of
members  to keep  the DSA  going. Donations  of any  amount,
large or small, are welcome and needed.

A  donation   of  $10;  ($12.)  will   procure  Subscription
membership, and entitles the payer to receive both a digital
and  a paper  copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other
members will  receive only  a digital  copy. To  invoke this
privilege, please  notify the  Editor of the  Bulletin, Mike
deVlieger, at

    mdevlieger@dozenal.org

As members know, we are  a volunteer organization which pays
no salaries.  As such,  every penny  you donate  goes toward
furthering the DSA's goals.

It may be worth considering  a monthly donation; say, $3, or
$6, or whatever seems reasonable to  you. This can be set up
quite  easily  with  Paypal  or WePay,  both  of  which  are
available at our web site.

Of course,  if you prefer to  donate by check, you  may send
them to our worthy Treasurer,  Jay Schiffman, payable to the
Dozenal Society of America, at:

----------------------Member Benefits-----------------------

Chief  among  the benefits  of  membership,  aside from  the
knowledge  of supporting  the DSA's  mission, is  receipt of
_The  Duodecimal Bulletin_.  In  addition, however,  members
also receive (digitally) a  membership card containing their
vital  member  information  and   a  monthly  calendar  with
dozenal numbers, containing suitable and educational dozenal
quotations and graphics, laid out for wall display.

To  receive  these, please  notify  us  that you'd  like  to
receive them:

=        NUMERICAL ABBREVIATIONS FOR FUN AND PROFIT        =
============================================================

According  to the  common  understanding of  the term,  this
little article's title has a bit of false advertising to it,
I'm afraid;  there'll be precious little  monetary profit to
any  of what  we're  preparing to  discuss. Of  mathematical
profit, though, there will be plenty; so in a more expansive
sense of the term, we will  see a great deal of remuneration
for our brief time together  today. So, without further ado,
let us proceed to the topic of abbreviating numbers.

In current  mathematics, we typically abbreviate  numbers by
using  what  is  often  euphemistically  called  "scientific
notation," and which is  more accurately called "exponential
notation." Suppressing our repugnance and working in decimal
for  the moment  (that is,  where "10"  equals "ten"),  this
notation  takes advantage  of  the ease  of multiplying  and
dividing by the  base of the system to  shorten long strings
of digits while  retaining ease in the  perception of scale.
For example:

    3.6 x 10^6

Printed above  we have a relatively  innocuous little number
(innocuous, that  is, other than its  unfortunate expression
in an  inferior base)  which, when written  out in  full, is
simply:

    3,600,000

We  expand the  number  by multiplying  by  the exponent  of
the  base attached  to  it;  here, by  10^6.  Since this  is
multiplication by the base  itself, the operation is nothing
more than  moving the  decimal point.  This method  is quite
frequently  used, especially  in physics,  where significant
figures of the answer often  limit the number of digits that
one can reasonably list out anyway, making this an excellent
way to write only the  significant figures and avoid writing
out a long string of meaningless digits.

Because this notation consists  simply of multiplying by the
base,  it  works just  as  well  in  dozenal as  in  decimal
(or,  indeed, in  any  other base),  and  sometimes it  will
doubtless be the most  convenient method to employ. However,
it's still  rather bulky,  filled with characters  which are
already understood  (namely, " x 10^"),  thus requiring more
characters  than  are  really necessary.  Inspired  by  that
divine species of sloth which fosters so much improvement in
our  methods, let  us consider  whether there  might not  be
better ways to accomplish this task.

We've  noted that  there are  unnecessary characters  in the
notation we  reviewed above;  we not try  a system  where we
simply get rid  of them, retaining only  the characters that
we really need? That is, the exponents?

    3;6^3

Ah, because this is ambiguous; do  we mean 3;6^3 (3;6 to the
third power, or 36;X6), or do we mean 3;6 x 10^3? Well, what
if we simply  reverse the order; put the power  of twelve in
the front, to avoid the confusion?

    3^3;6

This can mean only one thing; it is at once more concise and
yet equally  clear as the exponential  notation we discussed
above. We  can list negative  powers either by  putting them
superscripted in the  negative, as we would  an exponent, or
by putting them subscripted in the positive, like so:

    3_3;6

Because this system was  originally pioneered by DSGB member
Tom Pendlebury, it is often called Pendlebury notation.

This  system  combines quite  well  with  SDN, because  each
prefix  of SDN  corresponds quite  directly with  an integer
exponential value. For example, in SDN we refer to the third
power of twelve as *triqua*:

    3^3;6 = "three dit six triqua"

Or, of course, in the negative, replacing "qua" with "cia":

    3_3;6 = "three dit six tricia"

And the system really begins to shine with the unit names of
metric systems.  As an example,  we will take TGM's  Tim. In
TGM, all units have a standard abbreviation; for the Tim, it
is "Tm".  We can easily  combine SDN  with the Tim  (and any
other units  in any metric  system, really) by  referring to
unciaTim (one Tim multiplied  by the negative-first power of
10) or quadquaTim (one Tim multiplied by the fourth power of
10).  We  can  further  abbreviate in  writing,  though,  by
combining SDN with Pendlebury notation, like so:

    biquaTim    =   2^Tm    =   Tim x 10^2
    pentciaTim  =   5_Tm    =   Tim x 10^-5
    hexquaTim   =   6^Tm    =   Tim x 10^6

The concision and clarity of expression here is remarkable.

SDN also offers a few other options, though, similar to this
Pendlebury  notation. The  astute reader  will have  noticed
that each of  SDN's roots begins with a  different letter of
the alphabet. We  can easily, then, use  simply that initial
letter  as an  abbreviation,  without needing  a number.  We
can  do this  by either  superscripting or  subscripting the
letter,  as we  did  with  the numbers  above;  or by  using
capital letters for positive and lowercase for negative. For
example:

    biquaTim    =   2^Tm    =   BTm     =   b^Tm
    biciaTim    =   2_Tm    =   bTm     =   b_Tm
    pentquaTim  =   5^Tm    =   PTm     =   p^Tm
    pentciaTim  =   5_Tm    =   pTm     =   p_Tm
    hexquaTim   =   6^Tm    =   HTm     =   h^Tm
    hexciaTim   =   6_Tm    =   hTm     =   h_Tm

Typically,  though,  when  applying  powers  to  unit  names
the  simple  number  is  preferable, it  being  more  easily
distinguished from the  text of the unit  name. Letters tend
to be more useful when applying to digits:

    6^3;6   =   h^3;6   =   H3;6
    6_3;6   =   h_3;6   =   h3;6

So  we  have  a  great  variety  of  options  for  concisely
and  clearly abbreviating  our numbers  while simultaneously
improving  our  ability to  quickly  perceive  the order  of
magnitude of  those numbers. We  also have the  same ability
with units of measurement systems, which makes these methods
particularly powerful.

Back in February, Steve Lovelace  published a very short and
rather pessimistic exposition concerning dozenals, "An Intro
to Dozenal Numerals":

    http://www.steve-lovelace.com/an-intro-to-dozenal-numerals

Mr.  Lovelace identifies  the more  critical failing  of the
decimal system --- its dearth  of even factors --- and links
to the  Society's website. While he  doesn't believe dozenal
numerals would catch  on --- the cost, he says,  is too high
--- he clearly recognizes their superiority.

Robert Lindner at the Journal of Unsolved Questions, back in
March, briefly addressed why we  use the decimal rather than
the duodecimal system, coming up  with no good answer beyond
finger-counting:

An unsigned  article (that  is, signed  only by  an Internet
pseudonym,  "paradigmsearch")  gives  a little  tutorial  on
dozenalism, worth a read for the curious:

Ethan D.  Bolker, of the  Dep't of Mathematics  and Computer
Science at  the University  of Massachusetts at  Boston, has
transcribed  an  apparent  classroom  session  developing  a
dozenal number system:

Professor  Bolker also  has an  interesting site  containing
some images of that  great perfect polyhedron, the stellated
dodecahedron:

    http://www.cs.umb.edu/~eb/stellateddodecahedron/

Templates for building your own are promised, so that we can
all build our own and  "wish upon a stellated dodecahedron".
Professor Bolker's  image displaying  pi in dozenal  is also
worth a look:

--------------------Bulletin Publication--------------------

The _Bulletin_ schedule for the  next few months is slightly
changed. Rather  than having  deadlines on a  specific date,
you  can  expect  publication   of  the  _Bulletin_  in  the
following months:

December:  _The Duodecimal Bulletin_ WN X1, for 11E8 (2012.)
March:     _The Duodecimal Bulletin_ WN X2, for 11E9 (2013.)

This will have us caught up  to the current year, and future
issues published in 11EX (after WN X2) will be for that year
(11EX, or 2014.).

     Ode of a Young Decimalist on Discovering the Dozen

But soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east; the dozen is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious ten,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou, ignored by many, lost to none,
art so much her superior and lord.
Her vestal livery, adorned so poor,
with two green moons and five pathetic stars,
is worn by none but fools; I cast it off
for thee, the dozen, lord of bases all!
Your robes adorned with two bright suns of gold,
with three bright moons, with four more glor'ous stars,
and with six comets, bright to top them all,
with tow'ring crown upon your brow so fair,
thou leav'st all lesser numbers in the dust!

So much men talk of ten; yet, like the moon,
she hath no light but what the sun doth lend;
so thou, O mighty twelve, giv'st what dim light
the night of ten might cast upon the earth
while saving still illumination great
for when thou shin'st directly on us all,
to teach what number is, what numbers are,
the personalities of smaller primes,
geometry and physics; mighty twelve,
without thee math might just as well be Greek,
but with thee we can understand and love
now recognizing in the light of day
what once was dim and weak in ten's sad light,
what little it reflected of thine own,
a long, dark night; but now filled with thy light!

O mighty twelve, cease not to shed thy light,
thou queen of numbers, giving flight to night.

(With many apologies,  even more profuse than  usual, to Act
II Scene II of the great Bard's romance.)
