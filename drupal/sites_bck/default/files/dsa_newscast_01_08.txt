=                SDN for Word Construction                 =
============================================================

We saw, in Issues 01:06  and 01:07, the basics of Systematic
Dozenal Nomenclature  (SDN). To recap very  briefly, here is
the chart of SDN words:

    Num.    Part.       Pos. Power      Neg. Power
    -----   ------      -----------     ------------
    0       Nil         Nilqua          Nilcia
    1       Un          Unqua           Uncia
    2       Bi          Biqua           Bicia
    3       Tri         Triqua          Tricia
    4       Quad        Quadqua         Quadcia
    5       Pent        Pentqua         Pentcia
    6       Hex         Hexqua          Hexcia
    7       Sept        Septqua         Septcia
    8       Oct         Octqua          Octcia
    9       Enn         Ennqua          Enncia
    X       Dec         Decqua          Deccia
    E       Lev         Levqua          Levcia

We also saw that the simplest way  to use SDN is to name the
highest power in the number, and  then to list the digits in
order. For  example, the  current year is  11E9; in  SDN, we
could pronounce this as:

    11E9 = "one triqua one elv nine"

However, while  SDN makes  talking about dozenal  numbers as
easy  (easier!) than  talking  about decimal  ones, it  also
makes  it possible  to  dozenalize all  of our  nomenclature
without invalidating many  of the common words  we use every
day. For  example, consider the  words for various  types of
vehicle, based on the number of wheels they have:

    Wheels       Name
    ---------------------------------------------
    1            Unicycle
    2            Bicycle
    3            Tricycle
    4            Four-wheeler
    16;          Eighteen-wheeler

We  can see  that  our common  system  of cobbling  together
anglicized Greek roots breaks down  after three; but it will
please us  to note  that the first  three are  all perfectly
regular,  orthodox SDN!  They're not  irregular, just  magic
syllables which we must memorize to be correct; but they are
still the same words that we've grown up using.

However, SDN is easily able to  go up the chain here, making
words  for all  sorts of  vehicle which  are clumsy  or even
impossible in our current systemless system:

    No. of Wheels       Name
    ---------------------------------------------
    1                   Unicycle
    2                   Bicycle
    3                   Tricycle
    4                   Quadcycle
    5                   Pentcycle
    6                   Hexcycle
    ...
    16                  Unhexcycle

Our  famous "eighteen  wheeler," what  I grew  up calling  a
"semi" and what is  regularly called a "tractor-trailer," is
trival to name concisely and simply according to SDN. And we
can extend this even further.

Consider  our names  for polygons;  that is,  enclosed, two-
dimensional shapes. While these  follow a system, the system
is not normal for our language, nor is it well understood by
many.  Particularly  in the  simpler  shapes,  we have  many
irregular words; some polygons are named by number of sides,
some by number of angles; and when we get into higher ranks,
they start  becoming quite unfamiliar.  Below is a  chart of
our traditional  polygon names to demonstrate  the confusion
and difficulty.

    Polygon     Name                Number Word
    ----------------------------------------------
    3           Triangle            Tri
    4           Rectangle;          Quad
                    Quadrilateral
    5           Pentagon            Pent
    6           Hexagon             Hex
    7           Septagon            Sept
    8           Octagon             Oct
    9           Nonagon             Enn
    X           Decagon             Dec
    E           Hendecagon          Undec
    10          Dodecagon           Dodec
    11          Triskaidecagon,     Tridec
                    tridecagon
    12          Tetrakaidecagon,    Unquad
                    tetradecagon
    ...
    18          Icosagon            Vigi, Icosa
    ...
    20          Icosatetragon       ?

There  is a  system here,  but it's  opaque and  unfamiliar;
indeed, geometers  typically start referring to  polygons as
"n-gons" (e.g.,  "twelve-gon" or "thirty-four-gon")  just to
avoid this whole mess.

However, SDN makes these all quite simple:

    Polygon     Name                Number Word
    ----------------------------------------------
    3           Triangle, trigon    Tri
    4           Quadragon;          Quad
                    Quadrilateral
    5           Pentagon            Pent
    6           Hexagon             Hex
    7           Septagon            Sept
    8           Octagon             Oct
    9           Ennagon             Enn
    X           Decagon             Dec
    E           Levagon             Lev
    10          Unquagon;           Unqua; unnil
                    Unniligon
    11          Ununigon            Unun
    12          Unbigon             Unbi
    ...
    18          Unoctagon           Unoct
    ...
    20          Binaunquagon;       Binaunqua; binil
                    biniligon

We see here that the names of the polygons *exactly matches*
the SDN number root, making it easy to tell at a glance what
shape goes with what name and vice-versa.

We  see a  few  interesting  things here.  One  is that  SDN
sometimes provides more than one  possible name for a thing.
For example, the 10-gon is either "unquagon" or "unniligon";
both of these are  correct and regular, easily constructible
according to a short and simple set of rules.

"Unquagon" is  formed from  the the root  for 1,  "un," plus
the  positive power  suffix, "qua";  this forms  our regular
root  for  10^1, "unqua."  "Unniligon"  is  the more  direct
formulation; it  is simply  "un" for 1  and "nil"  for zero,
forming "10" in  words rather than digits, plus  "i" to make
it flow better and "gon" to show that we mean a polygon.

The same  thing goes for  "binaunquagon," which can  also be
called a  "biniligon." The  latter is easy:  "bi" for  2 and
"nil" for  zero, writing "20"  in words rather  than digits.
The  former is  likewise simple,  though a  bit less  so. We
start  with "unquagon";  but this  time, we  want "unquagon"
multiplied by 2. So we use  our root for 2, "bi," and attach
it. However, "biunquagon" would look like 10^21, much larger
than  our intended  meaning  of  "2 x  10^1";  so to  ensure
clarity of meaning, we add "na" to separate the two.

This provides a  good segue into the full power  of SDN. The
table given  above is E0  perbiqua (SDN for "per  gross") of
what any user of SDN needs.  However, there is more for when
we need it. Specifically, there are the *multiplier forms*:

    Part.   Mult.      Pos. Power      Neg. Power
    ------  ------     -----------     ------------
    Nil     Nili       Nilqua          Nilcia
    Un      Uni        Unqua           Uncia
    Bi      Bina       Biqua           Bicia
    Tri     Trina      Triqua          Tricia
    Quad    Quadra     Quadqua         Quadcia
    Pent    Penta      Pentqua         Pentcia
    Hex     Hexa       Hexqua          Hexcia
    Sept    Septa      Septqua         Septcia
    Oct     Octa       Octqua          Octcia
    Enn     Enna       Ennqua          Enncia
    Dec     Deca       Decqua          Deccia
    Lev     Leva       Levqua          Levcia

These multiplier forms,  as can be seen,  are typically just
the  root  particular  plus  a vowel,  either  "a"  or  "i".
However, when the  root particle ends in a vowel,  an "n" is
added,  as well;  this avoids  such ugliness  as "biaunqua."
Further, "quad" becomes "quadra,"  in accordance with normal
usage.

These  multiplier forms  are  used  for disambiguation.  The
example above of binaunquagon  (2 x 10^1-gon) and biunquagon
(10^21-gon) is an obvious  example. Another example might be
a 200th anniversary (for  more on anniversaries, see below).
A  town  celebrating  its  200th anniversary  (in  SDN,  its
"two  biqua  anniversary")  might  want to  put  up  banners
proclaiming  this  fact,  as   they  often  do  to  proclaim
sesquiduplicentennials  and  other decimal  silliness.  This
is  a  "binabiquennium,"  taking  care to  use  "bina,"  the
multiplier form. To  leave it out and  have a "bibiquennium"
would be  to proclaim a  10^22 anniversary, which  is likely
quite  a  bit longer  than  this  particular town  has  been
around.

(Of  course,  one can  avoid  this  whole issue  and  simply
proclaim   a  "binilnilennium,"   writing  "200"   in  words
(bi-nil-nil)  rather than  digits. But  the other  forms are
there when we want them.)

Two  more   prominent  examples   of  SDN   simplifying  and
dozenalizing   our   nomenclature   are   base   names   and
anniversaries.

Base  names, of  course,  are  dear to  the  heart of  every
DSA  member.  However,  they   are  clumsy  in  our  current
nomenclature. Let's line  them up with SDN and  see how much
simpler we  can make  them. Throughout, in  SDN, I  will use
"-ary" as a suffix; however,  "-al" could be interchanged in
every or any case.

    Base    Traditional     SDN
    ----    ------------    ----------
    2       Binary          Binary
    3       Ternary         Trinary
    4       Quadral,        Quadrary
                quaternary
    5       Quinary         Pentary
    6       Senary          Hexary
    7       Septal          Septary
    8       Octal           Octary
    9       Nonary          Ennary
    X       Decimal         Decimal, decary
    E       Undecimal       Levary
    10      Duodecimal,     Unnilary, unquary
                dozenal
    ...
    14      Hexadecimal     Unquadrary
    ...
    18      Vigesimal       Unoctary
    ...
    50      Sexagesimal     Pentnilary, pentanunquary

Notice that many of these words are the same (e.g., binary,
octal), but that the system in SDN tracks the words we use
for successive powers of a dozen *exactly*.  Furthermore, we
can easily predict words for bases even if we don't actually
know them.

For  example,  without  either previous  knowledge  of  base
mathematics (or of the  Latin language), hearing "vigesimal"
carries no meaning whatsoever. However, with SDN, "unoctary"
or "unoctal" *immediately*  and *unambiguously* presents the
same meaning,  base 18;, to  anyone who knows how  to count;
that is, to practically everybody.

Anniversaries  are  another  common and  greatly  simplified
area  of  application  for  SDN. We  in  America  celebrated
our   bicentennial  only   a  few   dozen  years   ago;  and
"bicentennial" is an easy word  to figure out. However, many
localities celebrate  150.-year anniversaries,  or 350.-year
anniversaries; and  determining what to call  such things is
not  only  difficult,  but  also  productive  of  ridiculous
results ("sesquiduplicentennial" and such monstrosities).

The dozenal  analogs of these anniversaries,  of course, are
160 or 260;  but even the exact dozenal  duplicates of these
hard-to-name anniversaries, such as 106 for 150., or 18X for
250., are  just as  simple. The table  below contains  a few
major anniversaries  in both  dozenal and decimal,  with the
SDN name listed.

    Decimal     Dozenal     SDN
    --------    --------    ---------------
    5           5           Pentennial
    6           6           Hexennial
    10          X           Decennial
    12          10          Unquennial; Unnilennial
    15          13          Untriennial

    20          18          Unoctennial

    30          26          Bihexennial
    35          2E          Bilevennial
    36          30          Trinaunquennial; trinilennial
    40          34          Triquadrennial
    45          39          Triennennial
    48          40          Quadrunquennial; Quadnilennial
    50          42          Quadbiennial
    100         84          Octquadrennial
    125         X5          Decpentennial
    144         100         Biquennial; unnilnilennial
    150         106         Unnilhexennial
    175         127         Unbiseptennial
    180         130         Untrinilennial
    192         140         Unquadnilennial
    200         148         Unquadoctennial
    216         160         Unhexnilennial
    240         180         Unoctnilennial
    250         18X         Unoctdecennial
    252         190         Unennnilennial
    275         1XE         Undeclevennial
    288         200         Binabiquennial; binilnilennial
    360         260         Bihexnilennial

We can  see here  that it is  trivial to  name anniversaries
that  are  difficult  or   even  impossible  in  traditional
decimal-based  English  nomenclature.  The  ability  extends
well  beyond the  anniversaries  of  city-foundings and  the
like;  even wedding  anniversaries can  benefit. A  couple's
quadrunquennial (or  quadnilennial, if you will)  is truly a
great  accomplishment; but  what would  you call  it without
using SDN?

Next month:  SDN for *fractional* words!

----"Summer Reading:  'New Numbers'" by Charles Petzold-----

Charles  Petzold, a  mathematician  and computer  scientist,
some years ago  discovered the work of one  of our founders,
F. Emerson Andrews, _New Numbers_.

    http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/08/250954.html

He seems quite  taken by the text, and  has some interesting
comments  which  may  be   worth  perusing.  Thanks  to  DSA
Secretary Jen Seron (#3X2) for pointing out this text.

---------"The case for base twelve" by Eric L. Dion---------

Eric L. Dion, back in June, wrote a delightful two-part blog
post on  why we should  switch to dozenal. Oddly,  the posts
give no indication that Mr. Dion has ever heard of the DSA:

    http://dissentofman.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-case-for-base-twelve-part-1.html

Using lowercase Greek letters gamma and psi for X and E, Mr.
Dion explains  the nature of place  notation; the advantages
of base twelve; and proposes a system of nomenclature. Worth
the read.

We're proud  to repeat  our announcement earlier  this month
that _The  Duodecimal Bulletin_  WN X0  was published  on 15
September, a day ahead of our previously announced schedule.
Our editor  put together an excellent  and intriguing issue,
and we hope that the membership was able to enjoy it.

The _Bulletin_ schedule for the immediate future remains the
same:

Dec 10: _The Duodecimal Bulletin_ WN X1, for 11E8 (2012.)
Mar 01: _The Duodecimal Bulletin_ WN X2, for 11E9 (2013.)

This will have us caught up  to the current year, and future
issues published in 11EX (after WN X2) will be for that year
(11EX, or 2014.).

============================================================

The below was inspired by William Lauritzen's article in the
recent _Bulletin_ on versatile numbers.

For generations past, the primes have reigned,
    the scholars plumbing through their fertile depths,
all students drilling them with interest feigned,
    til later, scholars, they retraced these steps.
But primes, so still and dull, so sterile too,
    with but themselves and one to hold them up,
may scholars draw, but practice fail to woo,
    for practice with variety would sup.
But versatiles!  what joy you bring the soul!
    each with more factors than all less than you!
O infinite, like primes, no rule can poll!
    All are twelve's multiples or factors, too!
The source of usefulness in numbers all,
    without you senseful number systems fall!
