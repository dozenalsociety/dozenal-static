=               Goals for our Second Volume                =
============================================================

As we plunge out into  our second volume of this newsletter,
it  seems  appropriate  to  outline  a  few  of  our  goals.
Beginning in this first issue of 11EX, we hope to accomplish
two things:

    1.)  Encourage  the  participation of  more  of  our
    membership with  the Newscast. For example,  we have
    an Erratum  published below  that resulted  from the
    input of a member on  the article published in Issue
    01:0X; this  corrects a real problem  with the ASCII
    version of  one of the  notations we spelled  out in
    that article.  But more participation would  be even
    greater.

    2.)   Assist  our   membership   in  the   practical
    application of dozenals in  our daily lives. Dozenal
    is an interesting abstract  pursuit, to be sure; but
    it  is  also a  way  to  make the  real  application
    of  mathematics and  arithmetic easier.  We hope  to
    publish articles this year which will help, in small
    and daily ways, encourage  us to really use dozenals
    in our daily lives.

We are  very excited  about these goals,  and hope  that our
membership will  find this both  useful and worthy  of their
assistance.

============================================================
=                        DONATIONS                         =
============================================================

Members,  please  remember that  while  dues  are no  longer
required for membership, we still  rely on the generosity of
members  to keep  the DSA  going. Donations  of any  amount,
large or small, are welcome and needed.

A  donation   of  $10;  ($12.)  will   procure  Subscription
membership, and entitles the payer to receive both a digital
and  a paper  copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other
members will  receive only  a digital  copy. To  invoke this
privilege, please  notify the  Editor of the  Bulletin, Mike
deVlieger, at

    mdevlieger@dozenal.org

As members know, we are  a volunteer organization which pays
no salaries.  As such,  every penny  you donate  goes toward
furthering the DSA's goals.

It may be worth considering  a monthly donation; say, $3, or
$6, or whatever seems reasonable to  you. This can be set up
quite  easily  with  Paypal  or WePay,  both  of  which  are
available at our web site.

Of course,  if you prefer to  donate by check, you  may send
them to our worthy Treasurer,  Jay Schiffman, payable to the
Dozenal Society of America, at:

----------------------Member Benefits-----------------------

Chief  among  the benefits  of  membership,  aside from  the
knowledge  of supporting  the DSA's  mission, is  receipt of
_The  Duodecimal Bulletin_.  In  addition, however,  members
also receive (digitally) a  membership card containing their
vital  member  information  and   a  monthly  calendar  with
dozenal numbers, containing suitable and educational dozenal
quotations and graphics, laid out for wall display.

To  receive  these, please  notify  us  that you'd  like  to
receive them:

============================================================

It  has  often been  difficult  for  those attached  to  the
dozenal base to actually use that base in their daily lives.
Now, we can buy dozenal calendars  to help begin, in a small
way, to change that. These  items are all presented entirely
in dozenal:

    Wall Calendar for 11EX, stapled binding ($11.60):
        http://www.lulu.com/shop/donald-goodman/dsa-wall-calendar-11ex-stapled/paperback/product-21221299.html
    Wall Calendar for 11EX, coiled binding ($16.70):
        http://www.lulu.com/shop/donald-goodman/dsa-wall-calendar-11ex-coiled/paperback/product-21223106.html

These are "wall calendars," intended for hanging open on the
wall or laying  out on a desk; facing each  calendar page is
some dozenal-related  image with some salutary  dozenal fact
or quotation  accompanying it. An ideal  conversation piece,
if nothing else; hang them on the office wall and respond to
comments. Also,  of course, useful for  keeping appointments
and dates.  These are in full color; hence the price.

There is also a weekly planner available:

    Weekly Calendar for 11EX ($11.29):
        http://www.lulu.com/shop/donald-goodman/weekly-calendar-11ex/paperback/product-21242155.html

This  calendar  has  yearly, monthly,  and  weekly  planning
sections;  the  weekly  sections  are  broken  up  by  hour,
allowing appointments, dates, and scheduling.

All of these items are sold  at cost, in the hopes that they
will  assist in  the DSA's  mission.  They can  all also  be
previewed on  their respective  pages, so you  can determine
whether they would be useful to you.

So, to sum up:

    Monthly Calendar (stapled)      $11.60
    Monthly Calendar (coiled)       $16.70
    Weekly Planning Calendar        $11.29

Dozenal is  meant to be  *used*, not just  considered; these
items will hopefully help that become a reality.

=           ERRATUM:  MATHEMATICAL ABBREVIATIONS           =
============================================================

Our last issue proposed  an abbreviation for lengthy numbers
that consisted  of superscripting the order  of magnitude in
front of the relevant number; e.g.:

    3^3;6 = 3600

One of our  members pointed out, though,  that this notation
is ambiguous: it could just as  easily mean three to the 3;6
power as 3;6 to the third order of magnitude. Unfortunately,
we  ran across  the limits  of  ASCII text  here; while  the
typeset  notation  is  *not*  ambiguous  (the  three  should
be  superscripted,  the 3;6  inline),  it  is impossible  to
represent  this in  ASCII ("plain  text") in  an unambiguous
way.

In  ASCII,  perhaps  we  should stick  to  the  alphabetical
abbreviations, rather than the numerical ones:

    t^3;6 = ^t3;6 = 3600

Which, as long  as we are not using "t"  as a variable name,
should be reasonably clear.

============================================================
=    MATHEMATICAL ABBREVIATIONS, BY IMRE IPOLYI (#411)     =
============================================================

As for  my contribution, I  think I  should write it  to the
newscast address.

It's about the notation of subscript and superscript when no
graphical  text representation  is  possible  by raising  or
lowering  the characters.  Computer  code  is always  simple
text,  so 2^3  only can  mean  8 not  300, and  we also  use
variables, so a  variable name "a" with an  index "b", which
is noted "a_b", should not be confused with 0;0b.

I know, is  would be highly unusual to use  a number for "a"
in a  name for a variable.  Nevertheless, there has to  be a
clearly  different notation  for raised  and lowered  prefix
than for raised  and lowered suffix, to  avoid confusions in
program  codes  and  messages  that  don't  allow  spa[t]ial
positioning of  the characters  (sms, simple  email editors,
social media).

Example for the raised suf[f]ix:

2^'3 or '^2'3 or (^2)3 or (2^)3 or 2^!32

and lowered suffix:

2_'3 or '_2'3 or (_2)3 or (2_)3 or 2_!3

Probably the best of these 5  options would be the last with
!, maybe with some other easily accessible character instead
of !. Maybe not the ' sign as in the first example. That may
be  used to  mark  'bulks  of texts'  at  beginning and  end
similarly to (xyz) or "xyz".

I would suggest 2^!3 and 2_!3.

============================================================
=                 DOZENAL, PAPER, AND TGM                  =
============================================================

Paper is  such a mundane  topic that we rarely  consider it,
but it's  worth a little thought  on occasion. Specifically,
paper  by necessity  has  a *shape*;  and  given that  paper
is  practically  two-dimensional,  it  by  necessity  has  a
*polygonal* shape.  We occasionally  see sheets of  paper in
all sorts  of interesting  shapes; but  most commonly  it is
quadrangular,  and  then  most  commonly  rectangular.  This
brings into question the ratio  of the shorter to the longer
sides.

By  tradition,  the  "perfect"  shape  for  paper  has  been
the  Golden Ratio,  1;74EE6772... However,  rather close  to
the  Golden Ratio  is  1:sqrt(2), which  has the  additional
benefit that, when  folded in half, it produces  a new sheet
with  sides of  the same  ratio. This  is a  useful property
which  makes 1:sqrt(2)  the  ideal ratio  for this  purpose;
particularly  considering that  it's  at least  in the  same
ballpark as the Golden Ratio.

Traditional  paper sizes  came in  all sorts  of interesting
ratios, which  we mostly know  by their common  names. Still
familiar  to  Americans  are  (all sizes  in  the  customary
decimal)  "letter," 8.5x11  inches; "legal,"  8.5x14 inches;
and "ledger,"  11x17 inches. All  sorts of other  sizes have
formerly been common, here  and abroad, such as "executive,"
"foolscap," and so on, but most have fallen into disuse.

Metric paper  sizes are (unusually for  metric) considerably
more rational.  They are divided  into two series,  the much
more common A-series and the  B-series. Both of these series
have a  ratio of 1:sqrt(2)  from their short to  long sides.
The A-series is *area-based*; it starts with the A0, a sheet
of paper with an area of  one square meter with the required
ratio to  its sides.  This gets  folded in  half repeatedly,
with each halving incrementing its  number, until we get the
A4,  which  is reasonably  close  to  American letter.  This
continues  at  least  to  A-X (decimal  A10),  only  26;x37;
millimeters, for which  it is hard to  imagine any practical
use.

The  B-series is  *length-based*,  starting with  the B0,  a
sheet of  paper one meter  long on  the short side  with the
required ratio to its long side. This continued on until B-X
(decimal B10), only 31;x44;  millimeters, again difficult to
imagine actually using.

TGM,  a  consistently  dozenal and  coherent  metric  system
developed originally  by Tom  Pendlebury, wisely  adopts the
same  ratio for  its  paper sizes  as  metric did  (rounding
sqrt(2) to 1;5, which is  extremely close to the true value,
and which  makes these calculations *much*  easier). It also
wisely introduces two series: a Grafut series (length-based,
the Grafut  being TGM's  unit of length)  and a  Surf series
(area-based, the  Surf being  a square Grafut).  These sizes
are abbreviated with the  standard TGM abbreviations, Gf and
Sf, with the number of folds suffixed to it. So if we want a
very large sheet of paper, we  might take the Sf+3, which is
a page the area of one Surf (the Sf+0) doubled in size three
times, each  time preserving the  1:sqrt(2) ratio. Or  if we
want a rather small sheet, we  might take the Gf-5, which is
the initial page the width  of one Grafut (Gf+0) halved five
times, each time preserving the 1:sqrt(2) ratio.

Remarkably, this system produces paper sizes extremely close
to the current  standard metric sizes; in fact,  as it turns
out,  an A4  sheet on  the long  side is  a remarkably  good
Grafut ruler. The Grafut-series  corresponds very closely to
the A-series, while the Surf-series corresponds very closely
to the B-series.  The standard "normal" sheet  of paper over
much of the  world, A4, comes within less  than a millimeter
and  a  half of  the  Gf-1;  and even  the  A0  is only  4x6
millimeters  larger than  the Gf+3.  The Surf  series has  a
similarly close correspondence to the B-series.

This system of numbering makes  more logical sense, as well.
It allows for the possibility  of larger and larger sizes of
paper (it's  not at  all clear  how a  sheet larger  than A0
would  be named  in  metric;  in TGM,  it's  just Gf+4).  It
further follows the intuitive rule that smaller numbers mean
smaller paper, while larger numbers  mean larger, with the 0
as  the basic  size; in  metric's naming  scheme, increasing
numbers  mean decreasing  size.  Finally,  each number  *up*
indicates  a  doubling in  size,  while  each number  *down*
indicates a halving, which makes more sense than having each
number *up* mean a halving.

These sizes are  so close that, in a world  in which TGM has
taken over from  metric, the differences between  the A- and
B-series and the  Gf and Sf series can simply  be classed as
manufacturing error, without any  change to the equipment at
all.

We noted  in our  last issue the  interest generated  by the
fascinating shape of the stellated dodecahedron. Now, we can
easily  make  many  of  these shapes  by  printing  out  and
assembling simple patterns:

    http://www.korthalsaltes.com/model.php?name_en=small stellated dodecahedron

While I was quite taken by the small stellated dodecahedron,
a  great variety  of  other polyhedra  are available  there,
including a dodecahedron, a  great stellated dodecahedron, a
great  dodecahedron, and  others.  Thanks  to Gils  Korthals
Altes for making these available.

Incidentally, in SDN  we can refer to  the "dodecahedron" as
an "unquahedron" or a "unnilihedron," and the "dodecagon" as
an "unquagon" or "unniligon."

Dr.  Andy  Kass,  a  geophysicist for  the  U.S.  Geological
Survey, gave us  an explanation and defense  of dozenalism a
little over a year ago:

    http://faradaysheadache.wordpress.com/2012/12/13/the-dozenal-system/

By way  of explaining that  dozenalism will never  catch on,
Dr.  Kass states,  "We can't  even go  metric in  the United
States." What a  failure to adopt a  poorly designed decimal
metric  system  has  to  do with  adopting  a  well-designed
dozenal mathematical base, I'm not  sure; but the article is
worth perusing all the same.

Our own  Dr. Paul  Rapoport (#230)  was interviewed  back in
January  of last  year on  the CBC's  "As it  Happens", with
Carol Off and Jeff Douglas. You can listen here:

    http://www.cbc.ca/asithappens/features/2013/01/07/dozenal-society-man/

Dr. Rapoport  focused pretty strongly  on his clock,  but he
also  discusses  the  ease  of converting  to  dozenal,  his
membership  in the  DSA,  and other  matters.  It's a  short
interview, but quite interesting, and with a receptive host.

--------------------Bulletin Publication--------------------

As  you all  heard yesterday,  our esteemed  Editor, Michael
de  Vlieger,  has produced  another  issue  of our  flagship
publication, _The Duodecimal Bulletin_.  This issue, Vol. 51
Iss.  1  (WN  X1),  focuses  on  dozenal  nomenclature,  and
presents a full-length exposition  of the Systematic Dozenal
Nomenclature that we've reviewed over several months in this
Newscast.  We  hope the  issue  proves  as enlightening  and
enjoyable to our members as it was for us.

Our next issue will be published in March of 11EX; this will
have us  caught up  to the current  year, and  future issues
published in  11EX (after WN X2)  will be for the  year 11EX
(2014.).

A short  one this month,  which I  hope is suitable  for the
change of year.  As we think about time, we  can think about
the way  we measure  it; and  so the  old "Thirty  days hath
September" rhyme could use some updating to be dozenal.

    Dozen-six hath September,
    April, June, and November;
    The others count the same again,
    but one more day, a dozen-se'en;
    But February's dozen-four,
    in leap years count just one day more.
