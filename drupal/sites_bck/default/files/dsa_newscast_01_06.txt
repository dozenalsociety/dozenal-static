Dozenalists have long  argued about the proper  way to speak
when using dozenals.  Is it "ten" or "dek?"  Is it "eleven,"
"el," "elv,"  "elf," or something  else entirely? Do  we say
"twelve," "dozen," or what? And just what do we call a dozen
gross, anyway?

Traditional English has a system for talking about dozenals,
simple enough, which goes like this:

    Number (doz.)   Word
    -------------   -----------
    10              dozen
    100             gross
    1000            great gross

And we  can extrapolate from  these three; for  example, the
number  "743 2X9"  is "seven  gross four  dozen three  great
gross, two gross  ten dozen nine." This works,  in the sense
that it is functional; and this is usually the very best way
to  inroduce dozenals  to  someone who's  not familiar  with
them. However,  it is  clunky, verbose,  and (worst  of all)
ugly. Something better is needed  if we are to make dozenals
mainstream.

For many  years, the DSA used  the "do-gro-mo" nomenclature,
which  is  essentially  a  shorthand for  the  above  "plain
English" system. "Dozen" became  "do," "gross" became "gro,"
and "great gross" became  "mo," forming the following system
well-known to anyone who has perused the older issues of our
_Bulletin_:

    10          Do          0.1         Edo
    100         Gro         0.01        Egro
    1000        Mo          0.001       Emo
    1 0000      Do-mo       0.0001      Edo-mo
    10 0000     Gro-mo      0.0000 1    Egro-mo
    100 0000    Bi-mo       0.0000 01   Ebi-mo
    1000 0000   Tri-mo      0.0000 001  Etri-mo

And so forth, just as far as one cares to take it. This is a
much more robust system that the "plain English" method, and
served us  well for many years.  Some of us continue  to use
it.

However, even this  system has a flaw:  it's too provincial.
That is,  it fits  in pretty well  with English  (though the
fractional  names do  sound a  bit  funny), but  it fits  in
poorly or not at all in other languages. Dozenal isn't meant
to  be  limited to  the  Anglosphere,  and never  was;  it's
*mathematically*, not *culturally*, the superior base. So as
well as  this system has  worked, something better  is still
needed.

Enter  Systematic   Dozenal  Nomenclature  (SDN).   A  group
of  dozenalists  on  the  DozensOnline forum,  ably  led  by
John  Kodegadulo,  has  put   together  a  system  which  is
comprehensive;  systematic; simple;  and international.  The
system  manages all  these traits  at once  by adopting  our
elder,  Ralph Beard's,  Principle of  Least Change:  it uses
things  which are  familiar to  all of  us, changes  them as
little as  possible to accomplish  our goals, and  then runs
with them.

The familiar basis for SDN is the set of numerical particles
used  by  the  International  Union  for  Pure  and  Applied
Chemistry (IUPAC). IUPAC takes very familiar Latin and Greek
roots,  most of  which we  already know,  to form  the names
of  new chemical  elements  until they  can  be given  their
"official" names;  SDN adds  two new  particles for  ten and
eleven,  and then  applies  them in  preditable, easy  ways.
These particles, 0-9 already international standards, are:

    Num.        Part.
    -----       ------
    0           Nil
    1           Un
    2           Bi
    3           Tri
    4           Quad
    5           Pent
    6           Hex
    7           Sept
    8           Oct
    9           Enn
    X           Dec
    E           Lev

Further  particles   can  be   formed  using   the  familiar
principles of place notation; e.g., "25" is simply "bipent,"
the number particles  being put together just  as the number
digits are.

There's one more thing to add, though. To really press these
convenient little  particles into  dozenal service,  we need
something to indicate exponentiation. So we add to these the
suffix  "qua" if  the power  is positive,  and "cia"  if the
power is negative, like so:

    Num.    Part.       Pos. Power      Neg. Power
    -----   ------      -----------     ------------
    0       Nil         Nilqua          Nilcia
    1       Un          Unqua           Uncia
    2       Bi          Biqua           Bicia
    3       Tri         Triqua          Tricia
    4       Quad        Quadqua         Quadcia
    5       Pent        Pentqua         Pentcia
    6       Hex         Hexqua          Hexcia
    7       Sept        Septqua         Septcia
    8       Oct         Octqua          Octcia
    9       Enn         Ennqua          Enncia
    X       Dec         Decqua          Deccia
    E       Lev         Levqua          Levcia

So "10" is  now "unqua" (10^1); 100 is  "biqua" (10^2); 1000
is "triqua" (10^3);  1 0000 is "quadqua" (10^4);  and so on.
We literally  simply count the  digits after the  first, use
the corresponding word, and call it a day.

For example:

    7 82E4 XE45

In  the "plain  English" system,  this number  is borderline
impossible to speak; that is, it could probably be done, but
the  result would  be  so unwieldy  that  speaking it  would
communicate practically nothing to the listener.  In the "do
gro mo" system, we get the rather manageable:

    Seven gro bi-mo eight two el four dek el four five

But to speak this, we must recall that "bi-mo" means "10^6,"
we must  count out the  digits, we  must see that  we've got
seven gro of  bi-mo, and then voice  the number accordingly.
Doable, certainly;  but excessively  complex as well  as too
provincial in its roots.

In SDN, we simply count  the digits after the first (eight),
select  the   corresponding  and  very   familiar  numerical
particle (oct), add "qua" to  it (since it's clearly a large
number rather than a small one), and we've got the answer:

    Seven octqua eight two el four ten elv four five

SDN  is  at  once  simpler,  more  comprehensive,  and  more
international than other systems.

Expect a full exposition of SDN in an upcoming _Bulletin_;
until then, you can learn more at the DozensOnline forum,

------------------Livin' la Vida Dozenal!-------------------

James Hobbs, an engineering graduate student studying carbon
fiber  and other  composite materials  at the  University of
Utah,  has  written  an  excellent  little  article  on  our
favorite number base, "Livin' la Vida Dozenal!"

    http://mathematicianscientistengineer.blogspot.com/2013/04/livin-la-vida-dozenal.html

Mr. Hobbs not only knows and prefers dozenal, but uses it in
his  daily life,  as  does  his family.  He  uses TGM's  Tim
for his  time (essentially,  dozenalized hours  with dozenal
divisions rather  than sexagesimal) and  notes the use  of a
dozenal ruler, though  he doesn't say what units  are on it.
Describes very briefly the TGM  system and notes a couple of
its benefits. Definitely worth a read.

------60:  Behind Every Second, Millenniums of History------

This month, the DSA got a mention in none other than the New
York Times!  The Gray Lady  published a brief note  with the
above title  by Roni  Jacobson on 8  July 11E9,  which notes
that  ten "is  actually an  inefficient number  on which  to
build  a  numeral  system."  The  article,  which  primarily
discusses base  five dozen (sixty), mentions  the DSA toward
the end.

    http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/science/60-behind-every-second-millenniums-of-history.html

The article  was originally  published on  page D2  with the
headline "Take  a Number." Not  exactly above the  fold, but
still a little bit of good publicity.

Thanks to Professor Gene  Zirkel, former president and long-
time stalwart of the Society, for pointing out this piece.

----------------------Raenbo Dozenals-----------------------

Timothy Travis (#342), Society board member, has contributed
an article  with some  lovely graphics and  very interesting
thoughts  on a  dozenal system,  which he  terms the  Raenbo
system:

    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/raenbo-dozenals

In addition  to having  some beautiful graphics,  Mr. Travis
presents a few interesting thoughts, some new symbols, and a
truly beautiful  geometric design  for the backs  of playing
cards.

Which demands the inquiry: playing cards are a fundamentally
numerical pursuit.  Any ideas for dozen-centric  games? Send
them in!

--------------------Bulletin Publication--------------------

Many  of  you have  undoubtedly  noticed  that our  Bulletin
has  not  been  published  since 11E6  (2010.).  After  some
conversation with our esteemed Editor, Michael deVlieger, we
have established a publication schedule for the near future.

Sep 16: _The Duodecimal Bulletin_ WN X0, for 11E7 (2011.)
Dec 10: _The Duodecimal Bulletin_ WN X1, for 11E8 (2012.)
Mar 01: _The Duodecimal Bulletin_ WN X2, for 11E9 (2013.)

This will have us caught up  to the current year, and future
issues published in 11EX (after WN X2) will be for that year
(11EX, or 2014.).

---------------Potential Presentation at NCTM---------------

At  our   annual  meeting,   due  to  the   successful  ASEE
presentation discussed in our  last issue, the DSA suggested
research  into a  similar practice  next year.  That is,  we
wished  to  investigate  the possibilities  of  setting  our
annual meeting close in time to some mathematical conference
and submit a presentation  on dozenals and alternative bases
to that presentation.

This  year,  we  are  considering  setting  the  meeting  to
coincide  with  the  National   Conference  of  Teachers  of
Mathematics. There are two  regional conferences of the NCTM
next year, in October and  November, in Indianapolis, IN and
Richmond, VA.

We are in  need of people to help with  such a presentation.
If you  are interested  in doing so  in any  capacity, plese
write us at:

    Contact@dozenal.org

This could be  great publicity for dozenal  and the Society,
so please, write if you're able to help.

============================================================
=                    POETICAL DIVERSION                    =
============================================================

We noted last issue (Newscast 01:05) that the English tongue
has a great variety of rhymes, songs, and games suitable for
(and  actually used  for) teaching  numbers and  counting to
small children.  We presented  one, which included  not only
counting  but  also some  more  advanced  concepts, in  that
issue, as well.

This issue, we intend to  adapt many of our current counting
songs for dozenal, so that they can be used for teaching our
favorite number base. Most of these are quite well-known, or
at least  exist in quite  well-known variations, so  we will
only be  presenting the  new verses.  This policy  saves the
reader's  patience, as  well as  limits the  length of  this
newsletter.

Some of these, such as "One, Two; Buckle My Shoe," go beyond
the  decimal base;  they  are also  modified  to conform  to
dozenal. In such cases, however,  every effort has been made
to ensure  they conformity with  the original spirit  of the
rhymes, as far as possible.

It is certain that these are not the best that can be done;
please, send in your ideas for improvements!

ONE, TWO; BUCKLE MY SHOE
------------------------
Eleven, twelve; dig and delve.
Twelve-one, twelve-two; court the maids do;
Twelve-three, twelve-four; maids at the store;
Twelve-five, twelve-six; whip up the mix;
Twelve-se'en, twelve-eight; maids now must wait;
Twelve-nine, twelve-ten; plates empty again;
Twelve-eleven, twelve-twelve; go to the shelf.

OVER IN THE MEADOW
------------------
Over in the meadow, snuggled up in their den,
lived an old mother fox and her foxes 'leven.
"Bark!" said the mother; "We bark!" said the 'leven;
and they barked and they snuggled in their cozy small den.

Over in the meadow, huddled deep in her delve,
lived an old mother gophers and her little gophers twelve.
"Dig!" said the mother; "We dig!" said the twelve;
and they dug and they played in their mother's deep delve.

THE ANTS GO MARCHING ONE BY ONE
-------------------------------
The ants go marching ten by ten, hurrah!  hurrah!
The ants go marching ten by ten, hurrah!  hurrah!
    The ants go marching ten by ten,
    The little one says it's not the end,
And they all go marching down, to the ground, to get out of
    the rain!

The ants go marching 'le'en by 'le'en, hurrah!  hurrah!
The ants go marching 'le'en by 'le'en, hurrah!  hurrah!
    The ants go marching 'le'en by 'le'en,
    The little one stops to grab his pen,
And they all go marching down, to the ground, to get out of
    the rain!

The ants go marching twelve by twelve, hurrah!  hurrah!
The ants go marching twelve by twelve, hurrah!  hurrah!
    The ants go marching twelve by twelve,
    The little one stops to start to delve,
And they all go marching down, to the ground, to get out of
    the rain!

TWELVE LITTLE AEROPLANES
------------------------
(Modified from the traditional "Ten Little Indians," due to
the latter often being offensive.)

One little, two little, three little aeroplanes;
four little, five little, six little aeroplanes;
seven little, eight little, nine little aeroplanes;
ten, eleven, twelve flying high!

Twelve little, eleven little, ten little aeroplanes;
nine little, eight little, seven little aeroplanes;
six little, five little, four little aeroplanes;
three, two, one flying high!

CONCLUSION
----------

Other songs can be easily  modified simply by adding verses.
E.g., "Five green  and speckled frogs" and can  be made into
"Six green and speckled frogs";  "There were ten in the bed"
and "Ten  silly monkeys" can  be made into twelve  each. But
having  any of  these,  either simply  extended or  actually
changed, in  our repertoire  may prove useful  in explaining
dozens to others, particularly to the young.
