============================================================

Members,  please  remember that  while  dues  are no  longer
required for membership, we still  rely on the generosity of
members  to keep  the DSA  going. Donations  of any  amount,
large or small, are welcome and needed.

A  donation   of  $10;  ($12.)  will   procure  Subscription
membership, and entitles the payer to receive both a digital
and  a paper  copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other
members will  receive only  a digital  copy. To  invoke this
privilege, please  notify the  Editor of the  Bulletin, Mike
deVlieger, at

    mdevlieger@dozenal.org

As members know, we are  a volunteer organization which pays
no salaries.  As such,  every penny  you donate  goes toward
furthering the DSA's goals.

It may be worth considering  a monthly donation; say, $3, or
$6, or whatever seems reasonable to  you. This can be set up
quite  easily  with  Paypal  or WePay,  both  of  which  are
available at our web site.

Of course,  if you prefer to  donate by check, you  may send
them to our worthy Treasurer,  Jay Schiffman, payable to the
Dozenal Society of America, at:

    Jay Schiffman
    604-36 South Washington Square, #815
    Philadelphia, PA  19106-4115

----------------------Member Benefits-----------------------

Chief  among  the benefits  of  membership,  aside from  the
knowledge  of supporting  the DSA's  mission, is  receipt of
_The  Duodecimal Bulletin_.  In  addition, however,  members
also receive (digitally) a  membership card containing their
vital  member  information  and   a  monthly  calendar  with
dozenal numbers, containing suitable and educational dozenal
quotations and graphics, laid out for wall display.

To  receive  these, please  notify  us  that you'd  like  to
receive them:

    Contact@dozenal.org

============================================================

We are excited to announce the availability of calendars for
next year, 11EE!

The DSA  is pleased to  offer the following for  sale. These
are all either at cost, or the proceeds go to the Society.

    Wall Calendar for 11EE, coiled binding        $10.05
    Weekly Planner for 11EE                        $8.29
    TGM:  A Coherent Dozenal Metrology             $8.00

Prices are,  unfortunately but by necessity,  in decimal. To
find these works, simply go to:

    http://www.lulu.com/shop/shop.ep

and enter the appropriate  terms. E.g., searching for "11EE"
will turn up these calendars  and the planner; searching for
"TGM dozenal" will turn up the TGM book.

We hope  to offer  other titles, and  even some  other items
(such as dozenal clocks and the like), in the near future.

------------------------General News------------------------

A little write-up of dozenal  arithmetic, "How to Learn / Do
Duodecimal / Dozenal / Base 12 Number System - A Math Lesson
and Examples : 0-9 A B"  was noticed this last month; toward
the end it mentions and links to the DSA:

    http://paradigmsearch.hubpages.com/hub/duodecimal-base-12-dozenal

This last September, the blog of Math 3010 at the University
of Utah published an explanation and defense of dozenal back
in September last year:

    http://3010tangents.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/we-need-more-fingers-2/

Paul  Battisson  gives  us  an  interesting  explanation  of
dozenal with a separate-identity symbology and nomenclature:

    http://paulbattisson.com/the-nooka-counting-systems/

Sadashiv  Pradhan gives  us a  basic article  about dozenal,
with a  pessimistic outlook on  the prospects of  a societal
switch to it:

    http://sadashivpradhan.blogspot.com/2013/06/what-if-we-had-6-fingers.html

Zyvra  gives us  a  defense  of dozenal  and  some links  to
programs which can deal with base twelve:

    http://www.zyvra.org/lafarr/math/dozenal.htm

Finally,  we  ran into  some  links  on dozenal  clocks  and
calculators designed  specifically for Windows 8,  which may
be interesting to our members who use that operating system:

-------------Dozenal Android Apps Expected Soon-------------

Readers  may  recall  from  our  last  issue  that  the  DSA
discussed,  at  our  annual   meeting,  the  possibility  of
producing dozenal smartphone apps. We're pleased to announce
that some basic dozenal  smartphone apps for Android systems
should be available within the month. These will include:

    -A dozenal  clock, which provides a  dozenalized version
    of our current time, each hour divided into 100; units.

    -A  dozenal  calculator,  capable   of  the  usual  four
    functions, roots, powers,  grouping via parentheses, and
    rudimentary memory functions.

    -A metric  converter, working entirely in  dozenal; this
    converts  from SI,  English/customary,  and the  dozenal
    system known as TGM.

Also forthcoming is a dozenal  calendar app, which will keep
appointments by date  and time in dozenal. This  is still in
alpha stages and will probably be released at a later time.

---------------Assistance Needed for iOS Apps---------------

If you are  able to program or learn to  program for the iOS
operating  system  used  on Apple  mobile  products,  please
contact us  if you'd  be willing to  create apps  similar to
those above,  or additional apps  which might be  useful and
interesting to members of the DSA, for iOS.

The  DSA  is   pleased  to  announce  that   we  have  again
been   granted  our   501(c)(3)  status   by  the   American
Internal  Revenue Service.  This  means  that, according  to
applicable law,  your donations  to the  DSA are  once again
tax-deductible.

The  effective date  of this  exemption is  the date  of our
application;  namely,  May  21,  11E9  (May  25,  2013).  So
donations made after that date are tax-deductible.

May auld decimal be forgot,

May auld decimal be forgot,
and dozenal come rise!

    For dozenal should rise, my jo,
    for dozenal should rise!
    We'll see the fall of dec'mal yet,
    and dozenal shall rise!
