============================================================

Members,  please  remember that  while  dues  are no  longer
required for membership, we still  rely on the generosity of
members  to keep  the DSA  going. Donations  of any  amount,
large or small, are welcome and needed.

A  donation   of  $10;  ($12.)  will   procure  Subscription
membership, and entitles the payer to receive both a digital
and  a paper  copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other
members will  receive only  a digital  copy. To  invoke this
privilege, please  notify the  Editor of the  Bulletin, Mike
deVlieger, at

    mdevlieger@dozenal.org

As members know, we are  a volunteer organization which pays
no salaries.  As such,  every penny  you donate  goes toward
furthering the DSA's goals.

It may be worth considering  a monthly donation; say, $3, or
$6, or whatever seems reasonable to  you. This can be set up
quite  easily  with  Paypal  or WePay,  both  of  which  are
available at our web site.

Of course,  if you prefer to  donate by check, you  may send
them to our worthy Treasurer,  Jay Schiffman, payable to the
Dozenal Society of America, at:

    Jay Schiffman
    604-36 South Washington Square, #815
    Philadelphia, PA  19106-4115

----------------------Member Benefits-----------------------

Chief  among  the benefits  of  membership,  aside from  the
knowledge  of supporting  the DSA's  mission, is  receipt of
_The  Duodecimal Bulletin_.  In  addition, however,  members
also receive (digitally) a  membership card containing their
vital  member  information  and   a  monthly  calendar  with
dozenal numbers, containing suitable and educational dozenal
quotations and graphics, laid out for wall display.

To  receive  these, please  notify  us  that you'd  like  to
receive them:

============================================================

The DSA  is pleased to  offer the following for  sale. These
are all either at cost, or the proceeds go to the Society.

    Wall Calendar for 11EX (stapled binding)      $11.60
    Wall Calendar for 11EX, coiled binding        $16.70
    Weekly Planner for 11EX                       $11.29
    TGM:  A Coherent Dozenal Metrology             $8.00

Prices are,  unfortunately but by necessity,  in decimal. To
find these works, simply go to:

    http://www.lulu.com/shop/shop.ep

and enter the appropriate  terms. E.g., searching for "11EX"
will turn up these calendars  and the planner; searching for
"TGM dozenal" will turn up the TGM book.

We hope  to offer  other titles, and  even some  other items
(such as dozenal clocks and the like), in the near future.

Our  esteemed Editor,  Michael  deVlieger  (#37E), has  been
extremely  active  in  the Online  Encyclopedia  of  Integer
Sequences, vastly  expanding a  great deal of  sequences and
adding a few new ones, as well. Many of these are of general
mathematical  interest, and  have  little or  nothing to  do
with dozenal;  but some  are quite  interesting in  terms of
alternate bases. E.g.:

    A016051:  Primes that are palindromic in base 2.
    A068437:  Expansion of Pi in base 10;.
    A136698:  Final nonzero digit of n! in base 10;.
    A136762:  Leading digit of n! in base 10;.
    A201918:  Automorphic numbers:  n^2 ends with n in base
        10;.
    A027606:  e in duodecimal.

His  credits  span ten  pages  of  search results;  do  some
exploration  to  see  a  little  of what  one  of  our  most
prominent members  has accomplished.  This kind  of activity
does  worlds  to give  credit  to  our  members and  to  our
Society, and  we are grateful to  and proud of Mike  for the
time and energy he's put into this.

Other OEIS sequences that will likely be of interest to
dozenalists include, but are not limited to:

    A088154:  Value of nth digit in duodecimal n^n.
    A113016:  Digits strings which are prime in both decimal
        and dozenal.
    A113017:  Digit strings that are prime in decimal but
        composite in dozenal.
    A006687:  Dozenal primes.
    A140764:  Dozenal numbers equal to the sum of their
        squares.

To help dozeners take advantage of the OEIS, a young British
gentlemen  from  the  DozensOnline forum,  James  Wood,  has
written two scripts,  which can be used  with either Firefox
or Chrome  web browsers,  to dozenize the  OEIS in  a mostly
transparent way:

    http://www.webextender.net/scripts/show/103812.html
    http://www.webextender.net/scripts/show/175429.html

The first  of these adds  the sequence in dozenal  after the
decimal sequence, retaining both so  that we can compare and
use  both;  the  second  allow  searching  for  the  dozenal
versions of sequences. These scripts are greatly useful, and
their use is encouraged.

If  any  other  members  have  been  participating  in  this
incredible mathematical resource, please let us know.

-----------------------Annual Meeting-----------------------

At long  last, we  can announce the  location of  our annual
meeting! We will be making  our presentation at the regional
conference  of  the  National   Conference  of  Teachers  of
Mathematics  in Richmond,  Virginia on  Thursday, 11;  (13.)
November,  from  1:30  p.m.  to 2:45  p.m.  in  the  Capital
Ballroom of the Richmond Downtown Marriott.

Our  annual  meeting  will  be at  the  same  location,  the
Richmond Downtown  Marriott, on Friday, 12;  (14.) November,
(roughly)  from 9:00  a.m. to  5:00 p.m.  Attendees will  be
responsible for reserving their own lodging.

Due  to a  late notice  of our  program's time  at the  NCTM
conference, we  were unable to  set up our  meeting earlier,
for which we apologize. We hope that it will not be too late
for members to attend.

It promises to be an interesting meeting; look for an agenda
in the next _Newscast_.

=                    POETICAL DIVERSION                    =
============================================================

Two roots diverged in a yellow wood,
and sorry I could not use the two
and be one figurer, long I stood
and studied ten as far as I could
still wishing for virtues both old and new.

Then checked the other, the twelve, so fair,
and found it no doubt had the better claim,
because of its factors, perfection---o, care!
Why leave great twelve, once arriv'd there!
No other so small, yet with virtues the same!

And both that morning equally lay
before me; but one stood so tall!
I left the ten in the dust; that way
would ne'er again tempt me to say
that twelve has any less than virtues all!

Man shall be telling this with a sigh
somewhere ages and ages hence;
two roots diverged in a wood, and we---
we took the one with an even three,
and that has made all the difference.

(With thanks to Robert Frost.)
