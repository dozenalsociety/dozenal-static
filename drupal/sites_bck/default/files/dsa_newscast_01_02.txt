-----------------------ANNUAL MEETING-----------------------

The  DSA's  Annual Meeting  for  11E9  will be  in  Atlanta,
Georgia, on  19 June  (decimal 21 June).  We hope  that many
members will be able to join  us on our first annual meeting
held outside New York City in many years.

Additional information will be  sent out regarding venue and
precise times as soon as possible.

On 1X  June, the DSA  will be  presenting a workshop  at the
2013. Annual  ASEE K-12  Workshop on  Engineering Education.
See  "Dozenal News"  for more  information about  this great
education opportunity.

------------------------DOZENAL NEWS------------------------

The Society has published two newly remastered dozenal works
in the last month.

    -"Boxes &  Cans: Some Points  on Packaging," by  Troy of
    the DSGB.  This brilliant  article makes a  usually dull
    subject  absolutely fascinating,  and clearly  shows the
    advantages of  dozenal in packaging. In  fact, it proves
    mathematically  that  it's  actually  cheaper  to  build
    packages for twelve and pack only ten, leaving two empty
    spaces, than to  build packages for ten!  Well worth the
    read.
        http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/boxes-and-cans-some-points-packaging

    -_Dozens  versus  Tens_   by  Thomas  Leech.  Originally
    published in  10E6 (1866.),  this is quite  probably the
    first serious  full-length exposition of  the advantages
    of the  dozenal base  ever written.  At over  100 (144.)
    years  old, this  well predates  even Sir  Isaac Pitman.
    Explains  the  advantages of  dozenal  in  money and  in
    weights and measures.
        http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/dozens-vs-tens

The DozensOnline  forum has  been hosting  several extremely
interesting   discussions   about  dozenalism   and   music,
including  several   different  types  of  tuning   (as  in,
different from the normal equal temperament).
    http://z13.invisionfree.com/DozensOnline/index.php?showforum=5

The DSA  has also published  a new work by  Treisaran, which
simply and clearly sets out the major divisibility tests for
low integers in dozenal:
    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/dozenal-divisibility-tests-quick-guide
"Dozenal Divisibility  Tests Quick Guide" provides  a simple
and easy  fact sheet  for these  important tools  for mental
calculation.

The DSA celebrated Dozenal Pi  Day rather quietly this year,
with a special page on the web site:
    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/dozenal-pi-day-11e9-2013
The  page  received  just  over  two  dozen  views.  Members
with  suggestions  for  better   observing  this  and  other
mathematicals "holidays"  are asked to write  in and suggest
them, either  to the _Newscast_, the  DozensOnline forum, or
to individual members.

Finally, and  perhaps most important, thanks  to the efforts
of our able secretary, Jen  Seron, the DSA has been selected
from  among many  applicants to  present a  workshop at  the
2013. Annual  ASEE (Association for Science  and Engineering
Education)  Workshop on  Engineering  Education.  This is  a
great educational opportunity, for  dozenals and for all the
individuals  involved.  Many thanks  to  Jen  for making  it
possible.

The   workshop,   entitled   "Alternate-Base   Systems   for
Cross-Curricular  Fun  and Engineering  Applications,"  will
focus  on  using  alternate  bases,  including  dozenal,  in
measurement and engineering. Your officers and board members
who are  involved in the  workshop will of course  report in
future _Newscasts_ and the _Bulletin_ what will be done, and
how it went, in more detail.

----------------------SOCIETY BUSINESS----------------------

The  new  website has  been  a  big success,  maintaining  a
hit  count mostly  consistent with  the old  site. That  is,
switching  websites barely  affected our  Web visibility  at
all. All the  old links to the website still  work, as well,
but  are no  longer tracked,  so  the current  hit count  is
likely lower than reality.

All numbers in dozenal.

In March, we have regularly received above 100 hits per day,
and rarely fallen  below 80. Our busiest day  this month saw
1X2 hits  (E March). We saw  2579 page views in  878 visits,
viewing E1 unique pages.

Our  most  popular  individual   page  was  Jay  Schiffman's
"Fundamental Operations in the Duodecimal System," which saw
1E7  page views;  followed closely  by Gene  Zirkel's "Brief
Introduction  to  Dozenal  Counting," which  saw  196.  Also
popular were "Multiplication in Base Twelve," James Malone's
"Eggsactly  a  Dozen," "Decimal-Dozenal  Conversion  Rules,"
one  of  our new  articles,  "Boxes  & Cans,"  and  "Dozenal
Divisibility  Rules,"  along with  our  reprint  of the  TGM
system of metrology.

Visitors tend  to come to us  by searching for a  variety of
terms involving "dozenal" or "duodecimal," of course. We are
working  hard to  expand the  material on  our site  so that
users can  find us by  searching for other things;  music or
metrology, for example. If you have material that might help
with that, please let us know!

As discussed above,  the annual meeting for 11E9  will be in
Atlanta, GA on 19 June. We hope you will be able to join us.

---------------------POETICAL DIVERSION---------------------

A DOZENALIST, TO THE NUMBER TEN

O tyrant Ten, thou beast of age untold,
thou worr'some number, of divisors short;
too long hast thou to man thy weakness sold,
the change to better numbers to abort!

Too long hast thou, with meager five and two,
attempted to suppress the dozen's claim;
thou, though thou know'st him better by times two,
hast robbed him of his rightful place and fame!

So rise up, valiant foll'wers of the right!
Rise up and bear the Dozen's flag 'thout shame!
Throw down the tyrant Ten, let in the light,
the light of Dozen's glory, of the flame;

the flame of two and three and four and six,
that can the sorrows of Arithmos fix.

(With apologies to William Shakespeare.)
