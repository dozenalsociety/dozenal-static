  <title>Trigons to Triads:  A Play on Chords</title>
  <pubDate>20200522</pubDate>
  <language>en</language>
  <description>
    We're proud to publish this piece by Donald Hammond,
    which explains triangles, Pythagorean triples, and the
    relationship of these to musical notes, such that they
    can create a chord-dialer to select appropriate notes
    for major and minor chords.
