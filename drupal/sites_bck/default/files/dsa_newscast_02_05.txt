============================================================

Members,  please  remember that  while  dues  are no  longer
required for membership, we still  rely on the generosity of
members  to keep  the DSA  going. Donations  of any  amount,
large or small, are welcome and needed.

A  donation   of  $10;  ($12.)  will   procure  Subscription
membership, and entitles the payer to receive both a digital
and  a paper  copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other
members will  receive only  a digital  copy. To  invoke this
privilege, please  notify the  Editor of the  Bulletin, Mike
deVlieger, at

    mdevlieger@dozenal.org

As members know, we are  a volunteer organization which pays
no salaries.  As such,  every penny  you donate  goes toward
furthering the DSA's goals.

It may be worth considering  a monthly donation; say, $3, or
$6, or whatever seems reasonable to  you. This can be set up
quite  easily  with  Paypal  or WePay,  both  of  which  are
available at our web site.

Of course,  if you prefer to  donate by check, you  may send
them to our worthy Treasurer,  Jay Schiffman, payable to the
Dozenal Society of America, at:

    Jay Schiffman
    604-36 South Washington Square, #815
    Philadelphia, PA  19106-4115

----------------------Member Benefits-----------------------

Chief  among  the benefits  of  membership,  aside from  the
knowledge  of supporting  the DSA's  mission, is  receipt of
_The  Duodecimal Bulletin_.  In  addition, however,  members
also receive (digitally) a  membership card containing their
vital  member  information  and   a  monthly  calendar  with
dozenal numbers, containing suitable and educational dozenal
quotations and graphics, laid out for wall display.

To  receive  these, please  notify  us  that you'd  like  to
receive them:

The DSA  is pleased to  offer the following for  sale. These
are all either at cost, or the proceeds go to the Society.

    Wall Calendar for 11EX (stapled binding)      $11.60
    Wall Calendar for 11EX, coiled binding        $16.70
    Weekly Planner for 11EX                       $11.29
    TGM:  A Coherent Dozenal Metrology             $8.00

Prices are,  unfortunately but by necessity,  in decimal. To
find these works, simply go to:

    http://www.lulu.com/shop/shop.ep

and enter the appropriate  terms. E.g., searching for "11EX"
will turn up these calendars  and the planner; searching for
"TGM dozenal" will turn up the TGM book.

We hope  to offer  other titles, and  even some  other items
(such as dozenal clocks and the like), in the near future.

============================================================

Ten  is such  a  divisor-poor number  that  it obscures  the
relationship between  shapes and numbers. However,  with the
dozen, the most  important simple polygons have  a number of
sides  which  are factors  of  our  base, which  makes  that
relationship more clear.

For example,  we can take  a triangle  and bend each  of its
three sides  in the middle; this  will give us six  sides, a
hexagon, also a factor of twelve. Do the same thing with the
hexagon---bend  each side  in  the middle---and  you have  a
dodecagon (in  SDN, an unquagon  or unniligon), which  is of
course our base itself.

Take a square and bend each  of its four sides in the middle
this will  give eight sides,  an octagon. While this  is not
precisely a factor of twelve, it  goes into twelve one and a
half times (that is, three  eights are two twelves), so it's
still in a very simple relationship with the base.

The  same sort  of  thing works  in  three dimensions,  too,
though  it's  not  so  transparent.  Consider  instead  some
simple  facts.  There  are   nine  regular  polyhedra,  five
convex  and four  stellated: the  tetrahedron (four  faces),
the  cube (six  faces);  the octahedron  (eight faces);  the
dodecahedron  (twelve faces);  the icosahedron  (18; faces);
the  small   stellated  dodecahedron  (twelve   faces);  the
great  dodecahedron  (twelve  faces);  the  great  stellated
dodecahedron  (twelve  faces);  and  the  great  icosahedron
(twenty faces).

Notice how  frequently our  favorite number and  its factors
appear here!  For four  of the  nine regular  polyhedra, the
number twelve  is the defining characteristic  of the shape.
Of the remaining  five, the factors of twelve  are two more,
so  we have  six  of  the nine  (two  thirds, 0;8)  already.
Even  considering  the  octahedron, icosahedron,  and  great
icosahedron,  we  don't  lose  much. The  number  eight,  as
already noted, fits in quite well with dozenal (three eights
are two twelves); and twenty is just a dozen and eight.

So when  you observe shapes, consider  their relationship to
number.  Look  at  number  of  sides,  number  of  vertices,
frequeny of various shapes. I  think you'll find that shapes
based on  the dozen and  its factors are much  more frequent
than any others; and there is, no doubt, a reason for that.

The DSA  is pleased to  announce the publication  of another
historical dozenal work: "A Rational Solution to the Problem
of Weights and Measures" by  Sidney A. Reeve of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers:

    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/rational-solution-problem-weights-and-measures

Published  originally  in  1127   (1903.),  this  paper  was
originally given as  a talk at the New York  meeting of that
society in September 1126. Explaining the dozenal system and
putting forth  a semi-completed  metric system based  on the
yard, the  paper is  an interesting example  of a  brief but
sincere attempt to  urge the adoption of dozenal  by a major
organization.

Last  month  we were  excited  to  announce that  the  DSA's
program on  alternative bases  in education was  accepted to
the mid-Atlantic regional conference of the National Council
of Teachers of Mathematics in Richmond, VA this November.

We  recently   received  some  more  good   news:  the  same
program was  also accepted, independently, for  the regional
conference in Indianapolis, IN in October!

Professor Jay Schiffman (#2X8) has graciously volunteered to
give this presentation in Indianapolis. This is a great coup
for  dozens,  and  will  get the  Society  some  more  great
publicity.

                  From Doz'nalism in Glory

Let great Arithmos come to me,
and join with me each jovial blade;
come drink and sing and lend your aid,
and help me with the chorus.
    Instead of ten we'll use great twelve;
    the depths of number we will delve;
    the dec'mal base we'll surely shelve,
    from doz'nalism is glory.

Two factors simply isn't enough,
and missing thirds is awfully tough;
such bases simply aren't up to snuff;
a dozen is something better.
    Instead of ten we'll use great twelve;
    the depths of number we will delve;
    the dec'mal base we'll surely shelve,
    from doz'nalism is glory.

For six, for four, for three, and for two,
I choose the dozen, and urge it to you;
no other number so greatly can do;
so help me with the chorus.
    Instead of ten we'll use great twelve;
    the depths of number we will delve;
    the dec'mal base we'll surely shelve,
    from doz'nalism is glory.

To the tune of "Garryowen."
