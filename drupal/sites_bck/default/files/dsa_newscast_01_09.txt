============================================================

Members,  please  remember that  while  dues  are no  longer
required for membership, we still  rely on the generosity of
members  to keep  the DSA  going. Donations  of any  amount,
large or small, are welcome and needed.

A  donation   of  $10;  ($12.)  will   procure  Subscription
membership, and entitles the payer to receive both a digital
and  a paper  copy  of the  _Bulletin_  if requested.  Other
members will  receive only  a digital  copy. To  invoke this
privilege, please  notify the  Editor of the  Bulletin, Mike
deVlieger, at

    mdevlieger@dozenal.org

As members know, we are  a volunteer organization which pays
no salaries.  As such,  every penny  you donate  goes toward
furthering the DSA's goals.

It may be worth considering  a monthly donation; say, $3, or
$6, or whatever seems reasonable to  you. This can be set up
quite easily with Paypal or WePay.

Of course,  if you prefer to  donate by check, you  may send
them to our worthy Treasurer,  Jay Schiffman, payable to the
Dozenal Society of America, at:

    Jay Schiffman
    604-36 South Washington Square, #815
    Philadelphia, PA  19106-4115

----------------------Member Benefits-----------------------

Chief  among  the benefits  of  membership,  aside from  the
knowledge  of supporting  the DSA's  mission, is  receipt of
_The  Duodecimal Bulletin_.  In  addition, however,  members
also receive (digitally) a  membership card containing their
vital  member  information  and   a  monthly  calendar  with
dozenal numbers, containing suitable and educational dozenal
quotations and graphics, laid out for wall display.

To  receive  these, please  notify  us  that you'd  like  to
receive them:

    Contact@dozenal.org

---------------------------WePay----------------------------

We have accepted donations through PayPal for some time; now
we can also accept them via WePay, which allows donations to
be made  without having an  account. We hope that  this will
make it easier to support the Society.

============================================================

Continuing this month with  our series on Systematic Dozenal
Nomenclature  (or SDN),  let's begin  with some  review: the
basic SDN chart:

    Num.    Part.       Pos. Power      Neg. Power
    -----   ------      -----------     ------------
    0       Nil         Nilqua          Nilcia
    1       Un          Unqua           Uncia
    2       Bi          Biqua           Bicia
    3       Tri         Triqua          Tricia
    4       Quad        Quadqua         Quadcia
    5       Pent        Pentqua         Pentcia
    6       Hex         Hexqua          Hexcia
    7       Sept        Septqua         Septcia
    8       Oct         Octqua          Octcia
    9       Enn         Ennqua          Enncia
    X       Dec         Decqua          Deccia
    E       Lev         Levqua          Levcia

The simplest way to use SDN  is to name the highest power in
the  number, and  then  to  list the  digits  in order.  For
example,  the  current  year  is  11E9;  in  SDN,  we  could
pronounce this as:

    11E9 = "one triqua one elv nine"

We  also   saw  the   use  of   SDN  to   form  consistently
dozenal  words; for  example, "unhexnilennial"  for a  160th
anniversary, and quadrunquennial for a 40th anniversary.

We don't  always form our  number words focusing  on integer
ranking, however;  sometimes we  focus them  on *frequency*.
This  sort   of  wordsmithing  requires   constructions  for
fractional  parts;  for  this   purpose,  SDN  provides  the
following two particles: "dit" and "per." More on "per" in a
moment; for now, let's consider "dit."

"Dit"  is  well  familiar to  many  dozenalists;  initially,
many  dozen years  ago,  this was  an  acronym for  "dozenal
identification tag," and was used to pronounce the semicolon
by which  dozenal numbers  were differentiated  from decimal
ones.  Many of  us still  use "dit"  this way,  as a  way of
voicing the dozenal or Humphrey point. E.g.:

    4;5 --- "four dit five"

In  SDN,  it is  used  in  almost  precisely the  same  way.
Consider,  for  example,  a publication  which  is  produced
twice a  week. In our  current systemless system,  it's very
difficult to  determine what word to  use here, particularly
since, in  the last few  dozen years, the options  have been
confused  so  much  that  they have  nearly  merged.  It  is
"biweekly"?  "Semiweekly"? This  is a  hard enough  question
that most people simply  say "twice a week." (Traditionally,
the answer  is "semiweekly"; but  because so many  have been
so  often confused  by  this, "biweekly"  has become  nearly
synonymous, though technically it means "every two weeks".)

In SDN, though, we form  our number words precisely the same
way we  form our  numbers with digits;  we simply  use words
instead. What  we're really  talking about, when  we publish
twice a  week, is  that we published  once every  half week.
Half, in dozenal, is 0;6,  voiced "zero dit six." Therefore,
in SDN:

    twice weekly
     0   ;   6  weekly
    nil dit hex weekly

And for short, one may simply say "dithexweekly."

What  about one  every  two weeks,  the  literal meaning  of
"biweekly"? Well, that depends; if  we mean "twice a month,"
as we  commonly do, we do  exactly as we did  above, forming
"nildixhexmonthly."  If  we  really mean  biweekly,  without
regard to when the months fall, we say "biweekly," precisely
as we do already  (though "binaweekly", using the multiplier
form, would be more strictly correct).

We can do  this with many common  divisions; "quarterly" can
simply  remain  quarterly, of  course,  but  if we  need  to
emphasize  that it  is  a  quarter of  a  *year* that  we're
talking  about, we  can say  "nildittriyearly." We  can also
start easily using and talking  about divisions into a third
of  a  year,  every  four months,  either  "quadmonthly"  or
"nilditquadyearly."  Something  that  comes  due  every  two
months can be "bimonthly" or "nilditbiyearly." And so forth.

While the  mighty dozen  has more  and more  useful divisors
than any  other number in  its scale (as we  dozenalists all
know), it still doesn't have *all* of them, and occasionally
we do  have to use  some numbers  that don't have  short, or
even terminating,  periods. What if something  happens seven
times a year, for example?

(Seven  times a  year? Why  on earth...?  Take your  choice;
historical or symbolic reasons, perhaps.)

Seven times  a week, of  course, we call "daily,"  but seven
times a  *year* is  a bit  trickier. Nor  can we  simply use
"dit,"  for a  seventh  is a  very  clumsy digital  fraction
(0;186X35 repeating;  a six-digit  period, pessimal  for the
dozenal base). "Nilditunocthexdectripentennially" will work;
but  it's certainly  quite  a mouthful,  and  it's also  not
strictly  accurate, as  it only  lists one  period. This  is
where "per" steps in.

With "per", we can name  vulgar fractions exactly as we name
digital  fractions or  integers.  Here,  for example,  we're
talking about a seventh of a year. We write this as "1 / 7".
We can make this into simple, orthodox SDN by naming it like
this:

     1   /   7      yearly
    Un  per sept    yearly

Unperseptyearly;  seven  times  a  year. Since  "per"  is  a
reciprocal operator,  we can even  assume the "un,"  and say
"perseptyearly."

So  now  we  can  count  to  any  number,  large  or  small,
and  form a  number  word for  any  quantity, fractional  or
integral,  using  a  consistent, international,  and  purely
dozenal system. This is the power of SDN.

-----------New Article:  "Playfair on Dozenalism"-----------

We are  pleased to  announce the  publication of  an excerpt
from  an historical  piece  by John  Playfair,  in which  he
defends the superiority of the dozenal system:

    http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/content/playfair-dozenalism

Among the  earliest defenses  of base twelve,  Playfair here
regrets  that  the  French  Revolutionaries,  despite  being
willing to cast off almost  everything, were still too timid
to cast off the shackles of the decimal base. Short and well
worth the read.

--------------------Bulletin Publication--------------------

The _Bulletin_ schedule for the immediate future remains the
same:

Dec 10: _The Duodecimal Bulletin_ WN X1, for 11E8 (2012.)
Mar 01: _The Duodecimal Bulletin_ WN X2, for 11E9 (2013.)

This will have us caught up  to the current year, and future
issues published in 11EX (after WN X2) will be for that year
(11EX, or 2014.).

=                    POETICAL DIVERSION                    =
============================================================

While best known for "The  Rime of the Ancient Mariner," the
famed British  poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge  (1038-108X) was
also keenly interested in geometry,  and was so taken by the
simplicity and elegance of Euclid's first proposition of the
first book that  he write a poem about it.  It is reproduced
here:

A Mathematical Problem
----------------------
This is now---this was erst,
Proposition the first---and Problem the first.

On a given finite Line
which must no way incline;
To describe an equi---
---lateral Tri---
---A, N, G, L, E.
Now let A B.
Be the given line
Which must no way incline;
The great Mathematician
Makes this Requisition,
That we describe an Equi---
---lateral Tri---
angle on it:
Aid us, Reason---aid us, Wit!

From the center A, at the distance A. B.
Describe the circle B.C.D.
At the distance B. A. from B. the centre
The round A.C.E. to describe boldly venture.
(Third Postulate see.)
And from the point C,
In which the circles makes a pother
Cutting and slashing one another,
Bid the straight lines a journeying go,
C, A, C, B, those lines will show.
To the points, which by A. B. are reckon'd,
And postulate the second
For Authority ye know.
A.B.C.
Triumphant shall be
An Equilateral Triangle,
Not Peter Pindar carp, not Zoilus can wrangle.

I think we can probably  all agree that Coleridge's poetical
talents were  better spent  on other topics.  However, Jacob
Bernoulli, normally no poet, proved himself capable of quite
elegant verse in the following poem:

Treatise on an Infinite Series
------------------------------
Even as the finite encloses an infinite series
    And in the unlimited limits appear,
So the soul of immensity dwells in minutia
    And in narrowest limits no limits inhere.
What joy to discern the minute in infinity!
    The vast to perceive in the small, what divinity!

And, in the original Latin:

Ut non-finita Seriem finita coercet,
    Summula, & in nullo limite limes adest;
Sic modico immensi vestigia Numinis haerent,
    Corpore, & angusto limite limes abest.
Cernere in immenso parvum, dic, quanta voluptas!
    In parvo immensum cernere, quanta, Deum!

(Both texts are taken from  "The Verses of Jacques Bernoulli
on Infinite  Series", by  Helen Walker of  Teachers College,
Columbia  University,  in  David  Eugene  Smith,  _A  Source
Book   in  Mathematics_,   published  1149   by  McGraw-Hill
and  republished  1173  by  Dover.)  While  not  a  *strict*
translation, the English is quite lovely; and I think anyone
knowledgeable in Latin will enjoy the original, as well.
